I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I’ve got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ohh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ohh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You ask me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I’ve got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ohh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ohh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
”I’m sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now.
”Why?”
”Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (ohh!)
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
你那点伎俩还是别拿出来了
你那浮动舞台效果也逊爆了
你让我扮演小丑的角色
愚蠢至极的角色，不，我真的不喜欢你
我不喜欢你自导自演的闹剧
也不喜欢你笑里藏刀的嘴脸
你先发制人，咬定是我先惹的你
想颠倒黑白？不，我嗤之以鼻
但我懂得适时收手全身而退，待时机成熟重夺王座
亲爱的，我向来如此，浴火重生
我手里有一长串黑名单，恭喜你被我划了红线
我翻了翻你的名字，又再三确认
噢，瞧瞧你们都让我做了些什么
瞧瞧你们都让我做了些什么
瞧瞧你们让我如何回应
瞧瞧你们让我如何回应
噢，瞧瞧你们都让我做了些什么
瞧瞧你们都让我做了些什么
瞧瞧你们让我如何回应
瞧瞧你们让我如何回应
我不屑你们王国的钥匙
因为那些本属于我
你向我祈求一个容身之所
却把我反锁在门外，自己享用饕餮大餐(真是看错你了!)
地球依然旋转，每天上演着不同的戏码
但这不关我事，不关我事，我只能说恶有恶报
地球还是会转，我也始终确信
风水轮流转，善恶终有报
但我懂得适时收手全身而退，待时机成熟重夺王座
亲爱的，我向来如此，浴火重生
我手里有一长串黑名单，恭喜你被我划了红线

我不相信任何人，也不奢望别人相信我
我会做女主人公，在你的噩梦中缠着你
我不相信任何人，也不奢望别人相信我
我会做女主人公，在你的噩梦中缠着你
我不相信任何人，也不奢望别人相信我

对不起，您呼叫的泰勒已停机，请不要再拨。”
“为什么?”
“噢，因为原来的泰勒已经死了!”
