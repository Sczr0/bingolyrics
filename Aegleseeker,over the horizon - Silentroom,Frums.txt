The sky is being again divided, but not as it was by the girl in red.
The girl chased by shadows... she is there.
And there is a girl cloaked in light.
Yes...
Another "end" is manifesting.
With a sense that she might fall through the crack through which she bears witness,
Lagrange watches that ending transpire.
Beyond, to its conclusion. To the fall.To dissolution.
It makes her smile again, although she can see... what progresses now is a tragedy.
This is a dance of light and conflict...

And in that light, I find deliverance.
