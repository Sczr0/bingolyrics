How long
Can we stay awake?
Watch it all fall
Yeah we watch it all break
How long?
Till we all fade away?
How deep
Are we gonna sink?
Before we know it
We've been losing our dreams
How deep
Before we all fade away?
So where do we go
不知道从哪天起
墙上的电视机里
(And where is your heart)
播报有人迷失在空洞陷阱
(Show me the light)
无法忍受的沉默
代理委托的生活
对抗堕落的困兽
(Over and over)
找寻逃脱的绳索
(Over and over)
向着吹过冷冽的风它带走我的manic
抛去狂妄自大的偏执想法和现实对垒
越过这台阶 去寻找那规则 it's like magic
举起火把点燃驱散晦涩
All I wanna say
We all have the same desire
I come alive
Burn in the night like wildfire
Find me in the great unknown
I'm following the stars
Swear I will run until I run out of air in my lungs
Fighting for the ones that are lost in the hollow
I know it's hard to see it end
We're gonna make it out my friend
成长的所谓
擦干那眼泪
不待见的看法只是生活的点缀
我看过街头泛黄被涂鸦的墙上画着漫天星斗
也感受过随便潦草几行的谎言抛出就可以变成锋利匕首
历经着生离死别存亡的困兽之斗
管它能不能活
全力以赴的战斗支援朋友
哪怕它侵蚀我
支离破碎的身体变得不能掌控
哪怕
面目全非的身体变得不能掌控
管他的
我也绝不退让
I come alive
Burn in the night like wildfire
Find me in the great unknown
I'm following the stars
Swear I will run until I run out of air in my lungs
Fighting for the ones that are lost in the hollow
I know it's hard to see it end
We're gonna make it out my friend
You better run you better hide inside the eye of the storm
哪怕我身体变得面目全非不能掌控
You better run you better hide inside the eye of the storm
哪怕我身体变得面目全非不能掌控
You better run you better hide inside the eye of the storm
Run
You better hide you better run
RUN
We come alive come alive
In the dead of the night
Spread like wildfire
Circle you out
Call us the underdogs
Fighting in the silence, beat the odds
I come alive
Burn in the night like wildfire
Find me in the great unknown
I'm following the stars
Swear I will run until I run out of air in my lungs
Fighting for the ones that are lost in the hollow
I know it's hard to see it end
I know it's hard to see it end
inside the hollow we begain
We're gonna make it out my friend
RUN
We're gonna make it out my friend
RUN
We're gonna make it out my friend
