Does your mind ever wander elsewhere?
Like the very first time
That you set your eyes on me?
I remember that I wanted to spend time with you.
Somehow, without my realizing,
We just went on as friends.
Hey now, baby, I know that you're hiding.
There's something else that's lingering, oh.
Every time, I'm glancing, seeing if you've noticed me.
Every time I think, that, maybe it's just only me.
But I'd just been trying so hard, didn't notice that.
I'd missed all the sighs I'd seen.
If I'd known that, would we just be friends?
How it's plain to see you're the one for me.
Love is always a conversation.
There's not only a side.
If you open your heart, you will know that
Each facet only makes us stronger.
Every time you turn away, you always come to me.
Every time, we know that you can't really fight against it.
And in the end, there's no use in you running now.
We know that we can't resist.
So just give in and try it again.
How it's plain to see you're the one for me.
Feels so automatic.
This different kind of love.
It feels so automatic.
A different kind of love.
你的灵魂可曾在别处彷徨？
就像你我最初的那次
深情对望？
我依然记得呢 曾想与你共度时光
然而不知为何，我未曾发觉
你我一直仅是朋友而已
嘿，宝贝，我知道你在试图逃避
你的心中有什么挥之不去
我不时匆匆一瞥，看你是否注意到我
发现你的回望时，却不敢确定是不是我的错觉
但我过分急切地寻求着
以至于错过了 所见的一切暗示
若我曾知晓这一切，我们还会是单纯的朋友吗？
你会发现你乃我的天赐良缘
爱情是个相互的过程
仅靠一人无法维持
如果你敞开心扉，你将知道
这点点滴滴只会使我们更强
每当你逃避之时，你总是向我求助
我们知道你不能与之抗衡
到最后，逃避也失去了作用
我们明白彼此都经不起诱惑
所以别再抵触，再尝试一次吧
你会发现你是我的天赐良缘
这令人身不由己的感觉
是种不同寻常的爱情
这令人身不由己的感觉
是种不同寻常的爱情
