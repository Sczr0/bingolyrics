Don’t hold my hand for this part
Full speed ahead
I know you noticed right from the start
Had my head held high since it began
Cause I’ve laid it out for them
Just tell me could you get up
In the aftermath? Oh
Would you leave it all
Out on the table now?
Before the dust settles down?
Cause right before the sunrise
I can see the fear in your eyes
You thought I’d disappear for good now,
You thought you left me here for dead, dead, dead, dead
You thought that I’d be slowing down by now
But think again, think again, ah
You thought that I was gone for good now
Praying I’d turn around instead, hey, hey, hey,
You thought that I’d be slowing down by now
think again
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
It’s you and me
We’re going in
We’re going head to head
I’m coming at you like a bull,
All I see is red
A fire in my righteous eyes,
You can’t hide
Cause I’m the light illuminating every shadow oh,
I’m coming for you,
I can see it that you’re running low
Cause I’ve been reading the signs
I feed the fear in your mind
You thought I’d disappear for good now,
You thought you left me here for dead, dead, dead, dead
You thought that I’d be slowing down by now
But think again, think again, ah
You thought that I was gone for good now
Praying I’d turn around instead, hey, hey, hey,
You thought that I’d be slowing down by now
think again
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
So listen up,
I’ve got the holy light
At my command
And I’ve got trouble here for you
In my right hand
Cause you’ve been left now open wide
So justified
I won’t let the people down,
Gonna raise them high,
getting louder everyday,
Yeah we’re amplified,
Stunning with the light
You’re gonna want to be on my side
Ah
It’s over,
Ah
Cause I’m coming,
I’m coming for you
Yeah you know it’s full speed ahead
Cause I’m coming
I’m coming for you
Yeah you know it’s full speed ahead
You thought I’d disappear for good now,
You thought you left me here for dead, dead, dead, dead
You thought that I’d be slowing down by now
But think again, think again, ah
You thought that I was gone for good now
Praying I’d turn around instead, hey, hey, hey,
You thought that I’d be slowing down by now
Think again
Full speed ahead
在这段路上我不愿与你为伍
全速前进
我知道你们早就注意到我了
但我昂首挺胸，自始至终
因为我已经对他们说明清楚
你只需告诉我在我拿下冠军之后
你还能否站立如初？
要不你现在就坦白
把一切公之于众吧？
在尘埃落定前？
随着太阳升起
我能从你们眼里看到恐惧
因为你曾以为我会消失无踪
你曾以为把我弃置此地，我就会自生自灭
你曾以为我现在会慢下脚步
但是再想想吧，再想想
因为你曾以为我会一去不返
祈祷我会向现实低头
你曾以为我现在会慢下脚步
但是再想想吧
全速前进
全速前进
全速前进
全速前进
只有你和我
我们一同踏进这赛场
我们将正面交锋
我如天马般冲向你
目力所及之处都已染上红芒
正直的眼眸藏不住内心的火焰
你无处可躲
因为我是那驱逐一切阴霾的光
我冲你而来
你已经没有底牌
因为我一直在分析场上形势
恐惧已被我种进了你的心里
因为你曾以为我会消失无踪
你曾以为把我弃置此地，我就会自生自灭
你曾以为我现在会慢下脚步
但是再想想吧，再想想
因为你曾以为我会一去不返
祈祷我会向现实低头
你曾以为我现在会慢下脚步
但是再想想吧
全速前进
全速前进
全速前进
全速前进
那么听好了
圣光已在我这边
任我差遣
而我将把它带给你
以我右手紧握之枪
因为你现在已经露出破绽
如此有理有据
我不会让人们失望
我会把他们高高举起
我们的呼声在日益增强
我们的影响在日益增长
耀光炫目动人
你会想要站在我这边的
Ah
终局已至
Ah
因为我来了
我冲你而来
你知道的，我正全速前进
因为我来了
我冲你而来
你知道的，我正全速前进
因为你曾以为我会消失无踪
你曾以为把我弃置此地，我就会自生自灭
你曾以为我现在会慢下脚步
但是再想想吧，再想想
因为你曾以为我会一去不返
祈祷我会向现实低头
你曾以为我现在会慢下脚步
但是再想想吧
全速前进
