Heard the letters you conveyed,would you feel I'm rain?
你说出那些话的时候 你是否会感受到我内心淋漓
In the broken sky,only sparkling light.
暮夜破碎 我眼里也只剩下星光熠熠
I used to believe in you,all time you can't be ture.
我曾经如此信任你 可你也并非时刻真诚
But remember,we had already been an ending game.
也请记住 月缺难圆 覆水难收
I know that what you see is what you get.
我如今看清 所见即所得
I found another one who can fill your lie.
我早已遇见能够兑现你谎言的人
For the unworthy of the times we had
对于我们曾经拥有的记忆
spark them firing into the broken sky
就让它们燃烧殆尽于破碎苍穹
Sometimes I sill cry
时而悲叹
pain and gain yesterday
过去的得失
when days go by
年华飞逝
and tell me where to obey
何去何从
you said you didn't want to deliberate
你说你并非有意
I see our skyline being deviated
我只看见彼此的轮廓线渐行渐远
where the city here we used to stay
在这座我们曾经生活的城市
The things I did for you were in vain
所有的事不过是徒劳
I know that what you see is what you get.
如今看清 所见即所得
I found another one who can fill your lie.
我早已遇见能够兑现你谎言的人
For the unworthy of times you deny
对于你否认的那些记忆碎渣
spark them firing into the broken sky
就让它们燃烧殆尽于破碎苍穹
