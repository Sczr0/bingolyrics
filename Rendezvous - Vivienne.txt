It started with a stolen glance
And followed with a silent chance.
Unburdened without any doubts,I
Found myself crossing paths,unexpected.
And up close,I indulged in the message.
Getting lured into a false sense of security
Before I could realize what started happening so suddenly.
What could it be?
Every time I try to look away,I can't help but peek.
I can't resist the way you smile.
I can't seem to hide the way I feel about you.
I just can't change.
There's no sense in pushing back against the truth.
I can feel without shame.
Even if after resistance melts away,it was not in vain.
Yes,I know now that this should be...
In secret,let us rendezvous,
With whispers in the afternoon.
Unburdened without need for words,I
Found myself longing after your presence.
And no longer die I try to fight it.
Getting lured into a false sense of security.
Before I could realize what started happening so suddenly.
What could it be?
Every time I try to turn away,I can't help but peek.
I see the way you look at me.
I can't seem to hide the way I feel about you.
I just can't change.
There's no sense in pushing back against the truth.
I can feel without shame.
Even if after resistance melts away,it was not in vain.
Yes,I know now that this should be...
Finding solace in the silence,hanging onto
A secret past.
All my memories falling down,cascade around us,the good and the bad.
Even if it's bittersweet,I've learned to savor this love we have.
Yes,I know now,as it should be...
Maybe best left unknown,with nowhere left to go.
那始于一次悄然的瞥见
紧接着 机会亦悄然而至
无需倾诉任何疑惑的我
忽然察觉，我已与你不期而遇
并且我深陷其中，禁不住拉近距离
这份虚假的安全感 却充满着诱惑力
还未意识到刹那间发生的一切 我便为之所缚
之后又将会如何呢？
每次都想尽力移开目光，却依旧忍不住偷瞥
你微笑的样子 令我难以抗拒
似乎我无法掩饰心中对你的感觉
如磐石般难以撼动
反抗现实有什么意义呢？
我已不再感到害羞
哪怕是抗拒感逐渐消失，那也并非徒劳
没错，我明白现在本应该如此……
让我们来一场秘密的幽会吧，
伴随着午后的低语
无需倾诉千言万语的我
忽然察觉，你的出现点燃我的渴望
并且我不会再选择将其抗拒
这份虚假的安全感 却充满着诱惑力
还未意识到刹那间发生的一切 我便为之所缚
之后又将会如何呢？
每次都想尽力移开目光，却依旧忍不住偷瞥
我也明白了 你如何注视着我
似乎我无法掩饰心中对你的感觉
如磐石般难以撼动
反抗现实有什么意义呢？
我已不再感到害羞
哪怕是抗拒感逐渐消失，那也并非徒劳
没错，我明白现在本应该如此……
于寂静之中寻觅着慰藉，紧攥着
神秘的往昔
我的所有回忆，无论美好亦或痛苦，皆如激流般倾泻于周身
哪怕是喜忧参半，我也懂得去享受这份我们共有的爱
没错，现在我已了然，它本应该如此……
或许保留未知感，无处可去，才是最好的选择……
