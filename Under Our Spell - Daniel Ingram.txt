（The Dazzlings）
Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
You didn't know that you fell
你们不知自己已弥足深陷
Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
（ Adagio Dazzle）
Now that you're under our spell
你们现在已经中了我们的魔咒
Blindsided by the beat
就在拍手和跺脚时
Clapping your hands, stomping your feet
猝不及防
You didn't know that you fell
你们不知自己已弥足深陷
（Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze）

We've got the music, makes you move it

我们让你跳 你就问跳多高?
Put your hands up to the sky
那就用手去触碰天空
We've got the music, makes you move it

Got the song that makes you lose it
我们的歌曲足以让你迷失

Listen to the sound of my voice
仔细聆听我的声音
Soon you'll find you don't have a choice
你已别无选择
Captured in the web of my song
被我的歌声所俘
Soon you'll all be singing along
你将会臣服于我
