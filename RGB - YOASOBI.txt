Don’t know where we disconnected each of our stories
Now we go, once again, past where we have split off
Even if, many times, we have been separated, you can see
We’re connected, still
So, goodbye, farewell then
We said the words, departed
How many morning suns have we seen ever since that day
In our respective new future destinations
Extension of that day
Today is when we meet
With every moment that leads up to our meeting time
I keep feeling my heart beating louder as the seconds pass
As I look up at the sky that has cleared from the rain
It was just like what we saw that day
Upon us was a seven-colored bridge
Here and now, we were able to meet once again
We have kept our connection alive all along
The things we talk about
We wanna speak about
Are never ending, overflowing out, and so
Hold up, this won’t be loosening, for we know
We were rushed by the seasons, forever moving
And beyond where the roads could be leading us to
No matter where we stand
As often as we want
We gotta tie our strings together like before
We’ll meet again soon
What was this?
And now, we cannot end the reminiscence
And those recollections, retentions
We trace and we laugh
Filling in sceneries we were living apart
The conversation offer a shortcut
And we don’t even need to worry about tomorrow
As if in a machine, and we’re back to our past
In any case
Some changes that each of us have witnessed
In total honesty, there’s been too much of them
But we know, till this day
It’s all of our surprise
That everything is still the same
When we look up at the sky, notice it’s turning white
We’re exhausted and we see upon one side of our cheeks
A gentle touch and a stroke from the warmth of the sun
It was just like what we saw that day
We return to our individual days
Hey, every step that each of us have walked up to now
Has been on separate pathways, we know
But the same morning sun is above and shining bright on us
We’ve got to, once again, overlap now
Don’t know where we lost connection within our stories
Once again, we return to what lies there beyond
The things we talk about
We wanna speak about
The pages will soon be filling up, you’ll see
So, now, let’s keep on adding to the story
Even the setting red sun we looked up at once
And the blue days of youth we have spent together
Our memories won’t forget
Never to fade away
And like the way the greens will always sprout
We can meet again some time
Our stories always start
With a white morning sunshine every time, and so
“See ya tomorrow”
未曾知晓我们的故事从何处开始中断
但如今 我们再次回到了分离的地方
如你所见 即使被迫分离无数次
我们依然紧紧相连
那么“再见”“再见吧”
我们这样说着，转身离开
从分离之日算起，我们已目睹多少次日出
在向着各自崭新的未来不断奔走的路上
再续初次见面的那天
正是久别重逢的今日
约定会面前不安度过的每分每秒
轻易感受到自己愈发怦动的心跳
抬眼望去，是雨后分外澄澈的青空
正如那日所见的风景一般
悄然出现在我们上方的 是七色虹
此时此地，我们重新相见
牵绊从未断裂，自始至终相连
我们谈论的琐事
我们想说的故事
禁不住翻涌而出，并将永无止境
好吧，如何能够放下，因为我们明白
四季匆匆，催促着我们一次次重新出发
在人生里交错展开的通往前方的道路中
无论彼此身在何方
无论会面多么渺茫
我们都会重新联结起从前的牵绊
因为相信着不久以后一定会重逢
这是什么？
而现在，回忆的过程逐渐变得无法暂停
往事和回忆的碎片纷至沓来
追溯着 找寻着 我们因之而开怀
一个人度过的那些曾经 被重新填满
谈话不知不觉间抹去了时间流逝
而且我们甚至不再需要担心明日
好像有一台时光机 让我们重回每一个昨天
我们应该都目睹了
一些难以避免的改变
好吧，它们的数量确实难以估计
可我们知道，时至今日
实在是令人难以置信——
一切 依然完好如初
我们再次仰望天空的那一刻，清晨正冉冉来临
温和柔暖的日光 轻轻抚摸着
我们疲惫不堪的侧脸
正如那天携手所见
我们将重新回到各自的轨迹
嘿，其实每个人走过的每一步
都刻印着全然不同的道路
但此时此刻，明亮地照耀着我们的却是同一轮朝阳
让交错的道路再度重合
未曾知晓我们的故事从何处开始中断
但如今 我们再次回到了分离的地方
我们谈论的琐事
我们想说的故事
使得空白纸页终将被重新填满，而你将作为见证
所以现在让我们继续补上这个故事吧
无论是曾共同仰望的鲜红夕阳
还是曾经携手度过的青涩时光
这些无法忘却的回忆
将永不褪色
就像草叶总会再生新芽
我们也一定会再度相见
因为我们的故事总是这样开始
每次都伴随着乳白色的晨曦，所以
“明天见吧”
