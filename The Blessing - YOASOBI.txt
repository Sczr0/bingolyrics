As you are now thinking of that star, so remote
此刻你念起那颗星 遥远如斯
You’re dozing off to be sleeping through with a thought
小憩片刻 梦中划过一刹妙思
And the future you decide
未来人生航向 由你掌舵
The way you want to stride
大步流星 顺遂你心
Wherever you choose to set off, to go
无论你选择何处启程 放手去做
Together, I’ll be there by you
携手并进 我伴你同行
You hold old memories, asleep in you
旧日记忆 沉眠于你心底
You then were taken afar so young to this star
年少如你 后被携去遥远的那颗星
Deep inside, the growing wish held it tight
内心深处 不辍萌发的愿景愈发坚定
Over there, a scenery that’s glittering
彼岸风景 生辉熠熠
If you could only jump and land in the globe you sight
若所见星球胜景 你能跃入其间 徜徉其里
It’s only you, so lonely in this domain
唯你一人 如今境地 孤独如许
Invoke and desire
唤起想象 生发渴求
Dream and hope you’re drawing
憧憬梦想 期盼希冀 你笔下正绘出
As you see the future
所见的未来
And if you choose to keep on marching on
若你选择继续前进
Instead of running off
而非逃避放弃
And cleared of any doubt
尽数消除心中疑虑
Not to be part of those images someone paints
别成为他人笔触下的一隅
Not advancing in that show, chosen by someone else
别踏上他人选出的秀场
You and I, ally to write our story
你和我 携手书写彼此的故事
Will never let you be lone and be gone from your side
绝不会留你孤身一人 离开你左右
Hidden out in your chest, and the day will come
深藏于你胸膛 那一天终会到来
When your blade will be cutting all those chains
你心中的刀刃 斩断一切枷锁
Unbound restraints
突破桎梏
At all times, together we’ll be fighting on
无论何时 你我并肩作战
Brought up in this predetermined fate
在注定的命运笼罩下抚养长大
Go ahead and crush it
去碾碎所谓命定
Breaking free, we never were some puppets to start with
挣脱束缚 你我从一开始就绝非傀儡
See, your realm ignites now
瞧 你的王国如今多么辉煌
Your future to shine bright
你的未来 将闪闪发光
Unbound possibilities, make it what you want to
不受限制 无限可能 随心就好
As to scoot, holing up as you ran up to me
而你飞快向我奔来 逃避躲藏
So, you climbed up in the cockpit and stayed inside
故你攀进驾驶舱 置身其中
That kid in scenes left in the past, no more to cry
那孩子将过去种种抛之脑后 拭干泪水
Before I realized, you grew to be powerful
我后知后觉 你已强大如斯
It’s your life, your story, your way
这即是你的人生 你书写的故事 你脚下的道路
And it’s not owned by anybody
并非他人所有 仅属于你
And it has no answer that is right
人生无正解
Up to you to walk the route you point at
脚下的路 由你抉择
Now the spell is broken
此刻已然破除诅咒的束缚
And as we’re now about to part with that fiction, defined
如今你我就要与那虚妄分别
It’s time to fly out to take off right now, ah
是时候远走高飞
At a pace no one can attain, speed away
逃离过往 无人企及
Kicking up the ground, soaring up the sky with you
一跃而起 与你携手翱翔天际
Covering the future, that curse to grip tight
尽管那诅咒如影随形 未来不甚明朗
As you are changing it by using your own might
而你正亲手去改变这一切
And by choosing not to run off, but to stride on
不选择逃避 而是大步前进
You extended the scope of all things you can reach out for
你已然突破 自身力所能及
Grow to become so powerful
成长得强大如斯
And on this planet, you were made to be born
这颗星球之上 注定有你降临
To keep on living in this world, as time is flowing on
就此活在世间 随光阴流逝
And so, you’d love it all, so you would treasure it
那么 万物都可爱 故你便会珍惜
May all blessings find their way to you
愿世间祝福 尽数予你
I’m wishing it
我祈愿如此
