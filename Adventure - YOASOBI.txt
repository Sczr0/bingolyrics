I leap out of the same routine I'm living day by day
To that astounding stage with all adventures waiting
My eyes are set on this globe, we can see it rotate
And then "hello," we'll say
A special day is a heartbeat away
Greenery, shining view
As a brand-new season has begun
There was me, staring at that blue light tone
And I don't even know all their faces
Not yet friends, but classmates only
It's nothing near what life should be
Contrast with that
Ideal I had imagined in my mind as
Days unfold and pass me by
But now, at last, we're meeting up
Reality and visions merging
So, my heart is pounding and
I cannot hold it back
We promised to meet and hang out
In that place I've been dreaming 'bout
A day we won't forget is now about to start
Opening with a spark
Matching dreams I had, visions and this day convene
Now I step outside the pace of my routine
And, if I take a picture, a piece of this scene
Ah, come what may
So many smiles on the faces I see
"Let's get on that," someone said, and we hopped on a coaster
The matching headbands we have put on
Priceless moments spill out, overflow, and still accrue
Even the waiting time, you know, is so dear to me too
Where should I be heading up to now?
I'm walking like I'm on a cloud
Oh, it's almost uncanny
As I'm noticing how quickly time is passing by
And the sun, on its way down
Unveiled a city view
Lights are shining on so bright, a parade of hues
I'll remember, forever
My soul is enthused
I'm so very glad I could come here
My heart's deeply moved
Matching dreams I had, visions and this day convene
I burst out of my everyday same routine
And if I take a picture, nothing will appear
Those memories are forevermore waiting here
Every season to come, they revolve on and on
In this very place, the smiles we've encountered, all
Flutter down and accumulate inside my heart
So, when can I see you again the next time around?
Step out of my regular day-to-day
To that eternal stage with all adventures waiting
My eyes are set on this globe, we can see it rotate
And then "hello," we'll say
A special day is a heartbeat away
我跳出日复一日的日程
步入那充满冒险的舞台
我的目光定格在这圆球上 我们可以看它旋转
特别之日 即将到来
绿意盎然 风景优美
此刻全新季节已然来临
而我 正凝视着蓝色光调
但我对他们太过陌生
并非挚友 不过同学一场
这与我的理想生活 相距甚远
与我脑海中的理想
形成对比
同时 时光缓缓流淌 朝我远去
而如今 你我终于相遇
现实与想象交融
所以 我正心跳不止
心潮澎湃 难以掩饰
我们曾许诺一同出游
去我梦寐以求的地方
你我难忘的一天 即将开始
就以火花 将其点燃
与我曾经的梦想 愿景和今日相匹
如今 我越出那单一的生活
倘若拍照留念 此刻场景
无论如何
我都能见到 许多满面的笑容
“咱们上去吧” 有人说道 而后 我们跳上过山车
我们都戴着相配的发带
珍贵时刻满溢 流淌而出 仍不断累积
即便是等待时间 我也认为如此甜蜜
如今 我该前往何方
我感觉自己正走在云端之上
简直难以遐想
我注意到 时光如何飞逝
而夕阳 西下
揭开城市景观
光芒闪耀 色彩斑斓
我将永远 铭记
我的灵魂 热情满溢
很高兴 我能来这里
我的心 被深深牵动
与我曾经的梦想 愿景和今日相匹
如今 我冲破那枯燥的生活
若我拍下照片 一切都无法浮现
这些记忆 将永远等待于此
每个即将迎来的季节 它们会在此处反复
在这特别之地 我们遇到的一切笑容
在我心中荡漾 直至填满
那么 下次 我会在何时与你重逢
我跳出日复一日的日程
步入那充满冒险的永恒舞台
我的目光定格在这圆球上 我们可以看它旋转
特别一日 就在眨眼一瞬
