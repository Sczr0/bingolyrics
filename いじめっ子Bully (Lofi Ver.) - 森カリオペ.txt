haze you.
She’s dressed up in diamond dust
A lover of decay
Coated lashes, soul of ashes
What more can I say?
踏みつけたアリの行列なんて
気付いてないと誰もが思う
Loving you, killing you, isn’t it thrilling? You’ve
Said enough from those guts you’ve been spilling through
Crying and begging, a lovely sound
I tear at your soul, but ya still stick around.
What I’ve found is a treasure indeed, a friend who can bend to my every need
I’ll use and abuse you and never feel bad until suddenly, funnily, you take my hand
Tangle you tight in the yarns that I’ve spun and I’ll
Do it again, to get what I want
Pretend that I’m harmless, I’m actually alarmed this is
Something charming to anyone… (wow)
The fact can actually make Death wanna Die?
I’m the one that you love, and I’m making you cry
And it’s “just me”, after all.
I’ll give you fire.
心に飼う
Hello? 餓狼 餓狼
唸り駆ける
また意地悪な爪を立てて狩ってあげる
haze you.
When the curtains finally close and the show’s really over
If you glance into my past, it’s just nothing new
Lying, conniving, thriving on hate
I’ll tell you it was “all for you.”
お聞きなさい
ホントの薔薇は自分の刺に
傷ついたりしないものよ
Ya know,
I want you to care that I want you to stay
So I swear I won’t blame you if you turn away
At the end of the day, I will smile and give in
To this burning and vile original sin
Cuz hell is the realization your selfish
And drawn to the loving, the soft and the helpless
I can see through that facade that you wear
When your honest, and promise you’ll fight the despair
And I’ll say it again, that I know I’m the worst
So then how can you spend so much love on the person that hurts you
Like I do?
Cuz inside, I can’t hide that I cannot desert you
And if I’m “the world” to you, surely you
Never stood even a chance at all, didn’t you?
It’s me, after all.
I’ll give you fire.
心に飼う
Hello? 餓狼 餓狼
唸り駆ける
また意地悪な爪を立てて狩ってあげる
来訪 宵の羽音
熟れ残果啄ばむ鴉かな
Don’t be afraid.
いい子ね もうお眠り
I’ll give you fire.
Just keep it to yourself.
Hello, the hungry wolf
Has come to give you hell
Once again I’ll treat you nice,
Think twice before you fall
And smile while you do.
Love, the me that’s killing you.
餓狼 餓狼 餓狼
餓狼 餓狼 餓狼
haze you…
