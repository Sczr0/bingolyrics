Been hurt so many times
A big hole’s been opened so
Been putting a needle through, pulling together
Protected it for many days
Closed my heavy lips
Held it together almost exploding
Been hurt so many times
Sewed the opened hole and hid
I want to try to be with you for as long as I can
Protected it for many days
Clenched my teeth when I wanted to spit it out
You know it hurt, being held
It’s not painful forcing it to close
I guess it’s my fault because I was exhausted
I thought I could still be of use
Before ripping off, our compassion slip past each other and we say goodbye
I guess it’s my fault because I was exhausted
Your smell still lingers
Before ripping off a little reluctantly, a goodbye
My face, my body hurt so many times but still can be used
Don’t leave me, I just don’t want you to give it to someone else
It is my fault because I was exhausted
I guess it’s my fault because I was exhausted
I’m thinking I was depended on
Can’t win against me before I was ripped up, brand new and unused
I guess it’s my fault because I was exhausted
I can still remember, I’ve just lost color
After ripping off a little reluctantly, a goodbye
我的心被伤害的频率 不可计数
因而出现一处空洞
引针穿过时 因痛苦而颤抖
我在此坚守的岁月 不可计数
太过沉重 缄默不语
紧紧拥抱 过于珍重 近乎破裂
我的心被伤害的次数 不可计数
将那空洞缝补隐藏起来
只为与你长久 长久地共度下去
我在此坚守的岁月 不可计数
几欲呕吐 咬牙坚忍
被你拥抱 过于疼痛​
强忍艰难 闭口不言 我也甘之如饴
我的身心早就疲惫不已 难堪大用
虽然还想为你分忧 却也有心无力
在支离破碎前 心留余念 擦肩而过 与你永别
我的身心早就疲惫不已 难堪大用
身旁还残有属于你的气息
在支离破碎前 仿佛依恋不舍 与你永别吧
即使是挂满伤痕的这张脸 这副身体 也是可以继续使用
不要抛弃我  拜托了 不要把我扔给其他人​
衰老而去的我已毫无价值
衰老而去的我已毫无价值
一厢情愿着 你还会对我有所依赖
当然比不过 支离破碎前的 纯洁崭新 未被使用过的我
衰老而去的我已毫无价值
回忆稍有褪色 仍然历历在目
在支离破碎前 仿佛依恋不舍 与你永别吧​
