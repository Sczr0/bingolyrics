Mend your pace, sway to the beat
Hands up! Embrace who you wanna be
We’re reaching heights unseen
Feel the fire deep within
You’re the key to where my trust begins
Join-my-dream, it’s just the right time
Leave it all behind
Get ready now
Rise
Up into my world
Renew your definition
World so high, let me show
And hear my declaration
No more ties
Off the ground and tap your feet
Look, stars are near when you feel the beat
We’re bound for a greater height
Take a leap into the blazing,
Don’t lose yourself in mundanity
Join-my-dream, it is the right time
Leave it all behind
Get ready now
(Sing along)
Welcome to my world
Renew your definition
World so high, let me show
And hear my declaration
No more ties
Welcome to my world
Renew your definition
World so high, let me show
Now hear my declaration
Welcome to my world
Renew your definition
World so high, we’ll show
and go beyond horizon
Side by side
