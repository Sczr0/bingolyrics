Charmer -This Or The Apocalypse
End me like a sick dog lose my body in vain
Break my horse's legs store me in a vase
I'll flight my way out by teeth
Wave the stampede on with a flag
While you've convinced yourself of your existence
As the only form of life
Bestowed beneath the gift of grace
If i fire it straight through you
My only hope is that it finds it's way back to him
If i fire it straight through you
My only hope is that it finds it's way back to him
If i said you were the source
I only lied to displace myself from the blame
If i said you were the source
I only lied to displace myself from the blame
You have nothing to be proud of
You have nothing to be proud of
If i fire it straight through you
My only hope is that it finds it's way back to him
If i fire it straight through you
My only hope is that it finds it's way
It's way back to him
I didn't feel the hate like this
I didn't feel the hate like this
But now
I can't find the words i can't let it go
Oh god i didn't feel the hate like this
My walk in amazement to the kill
Caught in it's glory
My walk in amazement to the kill
Caught in it's glory
My walk in amazement to the kill
My walk in amazement to the kill
My walk in amazement to the kill
As we are inert in our exalting awe
I'm not the jury or the judge
I am the gallows and the noose
I'll fight my way out by teeth
Wave the stampede on with a flag
While you've convinced yourself of your existence
As the only form of life
The only form of life
终结我如病狗 白失去我身躯
击碎我的马腿 放我入花瓶内
我会靠自己杀出条血路
用旗帜向蜂拥人群挥手
在你确信自己存在之时
作为恩典的馈赠下
生命的唯一形态
倘若我射它 却直接射穿你
我的唯一希望是它回到他身体内
倘若我射它 却直接射穿你
我的唯一希望是它回到他身体内
倘若我说过 你就是那起源
我所撒的慌只为逃避对我的责备
倘若我说过 你就是那起源
我所撒的慌只为逃避对我的责备
你没有什么能为之骄傲的
你没有什么能为之骄傲的
倘若我射它 却直接射穿你
我的唯一希望是它回到他身体内
倘若我射它 却直接射穿你
我的唯一希望是它回到
回到他身体内
我从没那么痛恨过
我从没那么痛恨过
但现在
我无言以对 我无法放手
我的天哪 我从没那么痛恨过
我们于惊诧中走向杀戮
沉浸于所得到的荣誉
我们于惊诧中走向杀戮
沉浸于所得到的荣誉
我们于惊诧中走向杀戮
我们于惊诧中走向杀戮
我们于惊诧中走向杀戮
因为我们对敬畏无动于衷
我不是陪审团 也不是法官
我是绞架 我是绞索
我会靠自己杀出条血路
用旗帜向蜂拥人群挥手
在你确信自己存在之时
作为生命的唯一形态
生命的唯一形态
