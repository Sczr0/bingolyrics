All alone again as he walks the empty path
踽踽独行 踏上旅途的他再度孑然一身
Searching for the place that he's seen inside his dreams
苦苦觅寻 只为奔赴梦中所见那方天地
Desperately he tries to find a way to quench his thirst
喉枯欲饮 寻泉辟路已然令他竭尽全力
As the memories begin to slip away
只因前尘往事已开始悄然散失
Losing sense of time as he walks the endless path
足迹斑斑 他已不知晓这不见尽头的道途自己行了多久
Never knowing if he'll reach the place inside his dreams
前路漫漫 他仍未确定那心向梦往的地方自己能否抵达
Picking up the scattered pieces of his broken heart
内心千疮百孔 他一次次重拾支离破碎的思绪
But the answer always seems so far away
但求索的答案尚在天边伸手难及
He tosses and he turns again
颠沛流离 一路饱经风霜
Throughout the night to ease the pain
披星戴月 但求苦痛得缓
The laughter dies inside head
早已无心欢笑
Only tears remain
只余血泪艰辛
And within the moment inside his dream
在睡梦片刻 他方才猛然惊觉
He's finding it harder to breathe
自身竟已然几近窒息
Let us stand upon this barren path and look to the sky
就让我们立足荒野僻路，仰望万里长空
Let our voices be heard, sing the song of our life
高唱生命绚烂，让你我歌声响彻四海
And the weight of the words echoing now in the deep abyss inside
纵使深渊幽暗，这振聋发聩如今在此回响
It's the sound that keeps me alive
正是这呐喊鼓舞我一路前行
All alone again as he walks the empty path
风尘仆仆 他又继续这无人作伴的远途
Searching for the place that he's seen inside his dreams
长路迢迢 他仍向往那魂牵梦绕的风景
Desperately he tries find a way to catch his breath
气短力竭 他尽千方百计只求苟延喘息
As the fleeting visions start to melt away
只因刹那芳华正散作泡影云烟
The only sound that fills the air
四下无人 耳畔不闻余音
Is the lonely rhythm of his heart
万籁俱寂 唯有心脉搏鸣
And the faces so familiar
往昔故人面容
Were no longer there
早已物是人非
And yet in this moment inside of his heart
然身临此刻 他方才恍然大悟
He's finding the answer he needs
所求解答竟早在心间
Let us stand upon this barren path and look to the sky
就让我们远赴蛮荒险境，直面天道无情
Let our voices be heard, sing the song of our life
讴歌生生不息，让众生怒号声震寰宇
And the sound of our steps echoing now from the deep abyss inside
纵然幽谷邃远，如今亦然回荡这铿锵足音
It's the sound that keeps me alive
正是这呼鸣驱使我一往无前
