All alone again as he walks the empty path
Searching for the place that he's seen inside his dreams
Desperately he tries to find a way to quench his thirst
As the memories begin to slip away
Losing sense of time as he walks the endless path
Never knowing if he'll reach the place inside his dreams
Picking up the scattered pieces of his broken heart
But the answer always seems so far away
He tosses and he turns again
Throughout the night to ease the pain
The laughter dies inside head
Only tears remain
And within the moment inside his dream
He's finding it harder to breathe
Let us stand upon this barren path and look to the sky
Let our voices be heard, sing the song of our life
And the weight of the words echoing now in the deep abyss inside
It's the sound that keeps me alive
All alone again as he walks the empty path
Searching for the place that he's seen inside his dreams
Desperately he tries find a way to catch his breath
As the fleeting visions start to melt away
The only sound that fills the air
Is the lonely rhythm of his heart
And the faces so familiar
Were no longer there
And yet in this moment inside of his heart
He's finding the answer he needs
Let us stand upon this barren path and look to the sky
Let our voices be heard, sing the song of our life
And the sound of our steps echoing now from the deep abyss inside
It's the sound that keeps me alive
