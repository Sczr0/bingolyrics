Dead beats swingin’ now
Grab the scythe and show them how!
Welcome to the mountaintop
Waiting ‘till the fight calls..
I hope you’re ready to be swingin’
‘till the night falls.
Are you a slave? An entertainer ‘till the fun dies?
I hope you’re ready to be swingin’
‘till the sunrise!
The Flame that faintly wavers
Stains the brain with flavor
The kinda pain that you complain about,
then learn to savor
A mystic walk beside the...
SADISTIC SAKURA
Kinda wished to talk with ya
Bore me, and it’s off with your heads!
I’m not’cha “sensei,” but I been saying sense
Since I began this soul sentence,
centuires of repentance!!
Past-tense on reservations now I stand in defense
Of this relentlessly intense advice
not lacking suspense
And guess the f**k what, ladies and gents?
I’m not even spent.
I’ll gladly live inside ya head
but who the f**k pays my rent?
It ain’t me, right?
So what’cha gonna do about it, sucker?
Cuz while the sayers say the same shit,
the doers fight each other~
Ya wanna stake your life on any of this?
There’s plenty of spite
To steel your nerves and feel the burn
The training starts tonight...!!
Welcome to the mountaintop!
Those your fans you’re countin’? Stop.
*throws my hands up stating the obvious*
Probably? That end was sloppy,
Gimme “Action,” sick!
Katana slashin’, slick!
But where’s your passion? Miss!
I’m only askin’
cuz truthfully y’all lose the heat
when seein’ no traction
But it must be how you’re waxin’
So trust me, start relaxin’
Your stance is...? well, it’s average...
I’m savage cuz I care
and you can take it or leave it
“RIP and tear” you swear to make me believe it?
Silent will, strike to kill, Shinobi-like technique
Pride or skill, what’s the deal?
Those hands are already weak?
Cuz bet this blood be melted iron,
but I still be like water
You’ll get some muddied up perspective
if you senselessly slaughter!
Those with devotion to the mission
straight devour the weak
An ocean full a competition,
get your actions to speak
You can't be strong if you give up
from just a miss in ya streak
I’ll say so long with a slight of the scythe
and a light kiss on thy cheek.おやすみ。
(Send them away, Death Sensei.)
(No ambition. Try again next week.)
Welcome to the mountaintop
Waiting ‘till the fight calls..
I hope you’re ready to be swingin’
‘till the night falls.
Are you a slave? An entertainer ‘till the fun dies?
I hope you’re ready to be swingin’
‘till the sunrise!
You gonna throw in the towel and quit
soon as your body starts bleeding??
You’ll say goodbye to glory,
next, “hello” to never succeeding.
So if you’d like to flip the story
and that heart is still beating,
I challenge you to stay committed
Simply follow my leading
Ya want a balanced following?
Then start creating, stop tweeting
This ain’t me hating, I’m just bored
from all the talkers I’m “beating”...
And getting sick of retching endlessly
from excuses I’m reading
But man, shit
Knowing their tendencies it’s no use,
you’re never leaving.
Sign up, then ya whine about it
Get in line, the stage is crowded
I can now supply with you with this “Tough Love”
Good luck without it!!
Welcome to the mountaintop!
Where we make the bodies drop.
Naughty boys and girls get chopped up
into diamonds, open shop
Copped a decent crop of follows,
all those asking me “how”
They spot the name, the fame,
start shaming, raising their brows
All like “Easy for your to say,
Little Miss Company Hire”
As if these moves did not take heartache
and these tracks are not fire!
As if this back did not break over and over?
I near expired!
As if a million skeletons hit
that “Subscribe” for satire!
And though this hell is ten times hotter
than the start, I ain’t tired!
Thank God I’m Death or I’d have drawn my last breath
and Peaced Out, or retired!
When it gets down to the wire, just who survives?
Are they the liars who sell their souls,
or those who dedicate their lives?
I’ll ask you.
Take up the sword and swing until it is unbearable
And wear your scars with dignity
when raising something shareable
The strong, the safe, the terrible-
progress in these eyes
Expect no less than Earth shaking
when these Dead Beats rise...
Dead beats swingin’ now
Grab the scythe and show them how!

跟着死亡节拍摇摆吧
拿起镰刀，让他们知道该怎么做！
欢迎来到山顶
等待战斗开始
我希望你们准备好摇摆起来
在夜幕降临之前
你是一个奴隶？还是一个娱乐至死的作乐者？
我希望你们准备好摇摆起来
直到天亮！
微弱摇曳的火光
污染大脑的气味
你抱怨的那种痛苦
那就学着去品味吧
一次神秘的散步
在悲情的樱花旁
我本来还想跟你们聊聊呢
烦死了，我要把你们的头都砍下来！
我不是“老师”，但我一直在跟你们讲道理
自从我开始了对这灵魂的审判
几个世纪以来，他们一直在忏悔！
那些原定判决已经是过去式了，现在我要进行辩护
对于这种无情且强烈的建议
确实不缺少悬念
猜猜怎么着？女士们先生们
我一点也没感到厌倦
活在你们的思绪中我轻松愉悦
但是你们谁能支付我的租金呢？
肯定不是我，对吧？
所以你们该做些什么呢？笨蛋
因为当只说不做的人在说着同样的废话
实干的人已经在互相争斗了呢~
你想把你的命押在这上面做赌注吗？
这里有很多怨恨
可以淬炼你的神经，让你感受灼烧的痛苦
那么今晚开始训练吧！！
欢迎来到山顶！
你在清点你的粉丝吗？停下
举起我的双手，告诉你这浅显的道理
可能吗？这结局太草率了
给我一点行动啊！笨蛋！
用武士刀砍他啊！漂亮！
但是你的热情在哪？小姐？
我只是随便问问
因为事实上你们都会失去热情
如果感受不到任何吸引力的话
但这一定是你打蜡的方式
所以相信我，放轻松
你的立
