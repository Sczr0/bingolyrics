(Now jump off, I don’t wanna wait for you)
Just make myself stupid
With no plan, I’ll do it
(Don’t chase what I really want, I do)
Took long to find out, but I decided where to go
Now jump off, I don’t wanna wait for you
Cold sweat, dropping from the cliff
See the truth
There is nothing to be frightened
Any more
Don’t chase what I really want
I do grab them all with my gravity
Like a magnet
That’s just about it
(That’s just about it)
Brace myself
You can not define me
In the different path
It’s not a drill, always real
You better know
Click click, it set right with me, I turn so
Quick quick, stars moving, like the warp zone
The sign tells me that it’s time to break free
Find the only way to run
With countdown 3,2,1
I said I’m ok
But i was not ok
Learnt many lessons but
They taped my mouth shut
A short break can’t help
Don’t let it stay dead
I’m gonna dive with no lifeline, ay
Take deep, deep breaths
Open my arms
That voice echoes in my head
Echoes in my head
Then everything falls silent
Now jump off, I don’t wanna wait for you
Cold sweat, dropping from the cliff
See the truth
There is nothing to be frightened
Any more
Don’t chase what I really want
I do grab them all with my gravity
Like a magnet
That’s just about it
(That’s just about it)
Brace myself
Just make myself stupid
With no plan, I’ll do it
Took long to find out, but I decided where to go
Everyday, my heart feels leaden
So numb, my sense is deadened
I’m not the only variant
In the city where they try to fit in
Sleepless night
Fight invisible enemies
Before I die
Make a fire to melt it
When you say
The time’s running out
But I’m still here
I’m gonna dive with no lifeline, ay
Take deep, deep breaths
Open my arms
That voice echoes in my head
Echoes in my head…
(Before my legs freeze)
Don’t get trapped in the chaos
To get myself under control
Bring the shock like a meteor
Wake up on my own to break it all
No time to hesitate
This pressure is on for me
Break it all
To get back on my feet
(Now jump off, I don’t wanna wait for you )
Just make myself stupid
With no plan, I’ll do it
(Don’t chase what I really want, I do)
Took long to find out, but I decided where to go
Now jump off, I don’t wanna wait for you
Cold sweat, dropping from the cliff
See the truth
There is nothing to be frightened
Any more
Don’t chase what I really want
I do grab them all with my gravity
Like a magnet
That’s just about it
(That’s just about it)
Brace myself
Brace myself
