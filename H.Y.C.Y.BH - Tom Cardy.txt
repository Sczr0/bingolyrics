Looking for his car keys

I don't say it yet
我暂时先不说
And when he gets me off the couch
然后他让我从沙发上起来
To check underneath the couch cushions
去看那玩意是不是掉进了垫子里
I don't say it yet, no
这时我先不说 对 不能说
And then when he says out loud
再之后他就搁那里大声嚷道
\"I wonder where my car keys are\"
“我钥匙到底上哪去了？？”
I still don't say it

(I still don't say it yet)

But then he asks me

\"Do you know where my car keys are\"

I look at him in his face and I say
我 死死地盯着他 然后问出那句话
Have you checked your b******e?

I have not seen your keys, but since you're askin' me
钥匙啥的没看到过 不过既然你问了我
You better check up that b******e
那你最好还是去检查下你的辟谷喔
Of course I'm not serious

I don't think it's up inside your big brown business
谁会觉得钥匙在你那又大又黑的玩意里面
But a funny thing to say
但我就是觉得一个人丢了东西而且肉眼可见地着急时
To someone who's lost their shit and is stressed out visibly
干这事真的非常好玩

Starts organizing an ad-hoc emu bob of the courtyard area
对会场进行全盘地毯式搜索
I want to, but I do not say it
难掩激动 但我还不能说！
It's the eleventh hour
最后一刻 迫在眉睫
With three-hundred congregates under God's roof
数百名宾客聚集在上帝的屋檐下
The vicar approaches the mic
牧师此时走到了麦克风前
And suddenly, all of the chatter goes mute
顿时议论声开始消退下去
He says that they've misplaced the rings
“我们把那对结婚戒指弄丢了，”
Could anyone possibly know where they are?
“有任何人知道它们在哪里吗？”
I know it's my time
闪亮登场的时刻已到
as all heads turn as I stand and say, \"Vicar\"
于是万众瞩目下 我站起来向他问道
Have you checked your b******e?
H.Y.C.Y.BH!!
Ski-dap, ba-dap, b******e
(炫舞)(炫舞)(匹眼!)
I have not seen your ring, but have you checked your ring?
我没找到你们的指环 但是你们可以找找自己的环
And by ring, I mean b******e
顺带友情提醒一下 我说的环就是那个意思
Love is patient, love is kind
爱是不厌其烦 亦是体贴关怀
