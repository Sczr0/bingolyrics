I appeared out of the dark after your father passed
I stood and took the place of all that emptiness
You said that you never thought god existed
But someone had to answer
To coincidences
So we'll just play it safe
And we'll forget that we ever had any questions
I said I'd give you everything I had
When I had nothing left
but I might just bring you down
I went from filling to becoming all that emptiness
that I saw inside you
And I would stay if I could just learn to shut my mouth
Cause everything I said just makes it so much worse
I work my hands down the bone
So everything I touch just feels like stone
Well, yeah, I sold myself short
You don't need me
No one does
Because I'm nothing to no one
I don't care if I make it
I'm stranded，I'm nowhere
I'm straight up sinking
I'm not letting anyone bother trying to patch these leaks
There's nothing to hold
Nothing to keep
My ship has sailed
I got stranded before the storm took over
There's only one way out
I was so tempted to give in a head for clearer weather
There's only one way out
And it's the hardest one to take
Because I'm nothing to no one
I don't care if I make it
I'm stranded，I'm nowhere
I'm straight up sinking
I'm not letting anyone bother trying to patch these leaks
There's nothing to hold
There's nothing to keep
And I prayed every single night before I slept
And now there's just no one to talk to
And I prayed every single night before I slept
And now there's just no one to talk to
我于黑暗中出现亦如我父亲曾经那样
我奋起夺回那片早已空荡的失地
你说你从不相信神明
但会有人告诉你真相
就这么巧
所以我们要谨言慎行
忘掉曾经的疑问并没什么
我敢说我已经倾尽所有
已经没什么可以失去了
我也许会令你失望
我想填补所有的空缺
所有你的空缺
我将留下直到我学会如何保持沉默
因为我所做的只会让事情每况愈下
粉身碎骨在所不辞
一切仿佛坚若磐石
是的，我出卖了自己
你已不再需要我
没人再需要我
因为我如此微不足道
我不在乎怎么回事
我已搁浅，无处可去
我径直沉没
没人可以修补我的船舱
没什么值得坚持
真的如此
我要启航
但在风暴来临前便已搁浅
无路可逃
我多想在一个明媚的天气出发
但真的无路可逃
前路艰辛
因为我是如此微不足道
我不在乎怎么回事
我已搁浅，无处可去
我径直沉没
没人可以修补我的船舱
没什么值得坚持
真的无所谓
我曾每夜在睡前祈祷
如今依然无人可以诉说
我曾每夜在睡前祈祷
多希望有人可以听我诉说
