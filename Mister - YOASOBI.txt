La-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la, la
Sit in a room so little, no one around, there is only me
And I'm recalling of what being by you used to be
Stage of the story, distant sighting buildings rise upon the scene
Standing tall, large in form in a big city that is seen across the sea
La-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la, la
I keep the day of our very first encounter in mind now rewind to the time you've entered
Formal in a shirt and jacket that were not fitting your inner side
You were concise and spoke a few words only absolutely so strict towards me
I remember scoldings often happened and still, all of the tools my heart runs on
Were covered up by a sense of weakness but yet
Then, I held the wish to comprehend all things about you from beginning to end
However, never could request it and without saying anything so softly prayed under the moon
Even if not much I'd like to understand so I spent lots of days in that state of mind
La-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la, la
La-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la, la
So, even though off and on you showed it in your motion
So peaceful and calm was your expression
You've only shown your tears once, that's all I know about
You could not conceal them as they came pouring out
Yes, kindness was inside and on that day came to sight
That day was the final time for both as I replay, the night overlaid
My hand in yours, I felt you clasping hard while smiling in the dark
But now, you are no longer here
In this moment, I wish I could hear
Once more, as before, I wish you'd let it reach my ears
Your compassion and hints of awkwardness
Interweaving through your voice firm, stirring words of forwardness
Wanting it now, and what is this I've found?
What is the name of what I'm feeling now?
What you've always done is all I'm calling for
As I wish for scoldings like before, mister
La-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la, la
La-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la, la
坐在房间里 感觉如此渺小 没有人在身旁 只有我自己
回想起过去和你在一起时的日子
故事发生在一个可以观望到远处
高楼林立的小镇 高大的建筑物矗立在 海对面的那座庞大都市
我依然还记得我们初次见面时的情景 现在倒回你出现的时候
穿着正式的衬衫和夹克 有点不合身
你言简意赅 从不多言 对我十分严厉
我时不时就会受到训斥 我心里的机械仍然运转
却被无力感包裹 但是
我仍然想要理解 你的所有 从始至终
但我从没有机会提出这个请求
我无言地在月光下轻轻祈祷
就算只是一点点 我也想要理解你 于是怀抱着这样的想法度过了一天又一天
你的一言一行中偶尔会显露
安静平和的模样
我只见过一次你流下眼泪
泪水喷涌而出的时候 你再也无力掩饰
心中温柔的善意啊
那一天终于流露出来 那是我们最后相处的时光 回想起那一晚
你握着我的手 我感受到你的紧握 你在黑暗里对我微笑
但如今你已不在我身旁
在这一刻 我多希望能再一次听到
你从前的呼唤 我多希望你的声音在我耳边响起
温情和一丝笨拙 交织在你的声音里
你那坚定又振奋人心的话语
我现在就想要听到 我发现的这种东西是什么？
我现在的感觉要如何名状？
我一直怀念着那时的你
请像从前那样训斥我吧 先生
