Stealing your heart she'll make you plead
Giving you something to believe
Like aye-oh, aye-oh, aye-oh
She's got them villain vibes, villain vibes
Got them killing vibes, killing vibes
Watch her taking lives, taking lives
Singing aye-oh, aye-oh, aye-oh, aye
Villain vibes, villain vibes
Got them killing vibes, killing vibes
Watch her taking lives, taking lives
Singing aye-oh, aye-oh, aye-oh, aye
She'd rather be the hunter than the prey
Rather be a killer than a saint
Either way she's still gon' make you pray
Maybe long ago was heaven made
But she slipped and fell along the way
Now she's got another role to play
So don't go
Playing with, playing with fire
Don't go
Playing with, playing with fire
Don't go
Playing with, playing with fire
Don't go
She's got them villain vibes, villain vibes
Got them killing vibes, killing vibes
Watch her taking lives, taking lives
Singing aye-oh, aye-oh, aye-oh, aye
Villain vibes, villain vibes
Got them killing vibes, killing vibes
Watch her taking lives, taking lives
Singing aye-oh, aye-oh, aye-oh, aye
She's got them villain vibes, villain vibes
Every time I see 'em
I- I- I'm crazy I know, I know she's crazy
But I kinda like, kinda like living on the edge of this
High, high baby I like, I like crazy
Strike that match and make it blow up
Hit that gas it's half of the fun
Don't show this to just anyone
But, but can't stop what you've begun
Smiled 'til the mischief felt boring
She ain't the hero just the villain of somebody else's
Story straight up predatory
Made up swagger what's the matter acting tough
Nah you not even in the same category
But ya fear the reaper like never before
Once you hear it falling deeper 'til she severs your core
Somehow begging for more
Bring them to life just to kill them again
Wing 'til the end with this scythe
Trust it's a thrill you'll never comprehend
Playing with, playing with fire
Don't go
Playing with, playing with fire
Don't go
Playing with, playing with fire
Don't go
She's got them villain vibes, villain vibes
Got them killing vibes, killing vibes
Watch her taking lives, taking lives
Singing aye-oh, aye-oh, aye-oh, aye
Villain vibes, villain vibes
Got them killing vibes, killing vibes
Watch her taking lives, taking lives
Singing aye-oh, aye-oh, aye-oh, aye
我劝你后退并跪下
偷走你的心  她会给你机会求饶
给予你信仰的东西
哦 哦 哦
她已陷入邪恶深渊，心狠手辣
面对他们杀气腾腾，凶神恶煞
看着她夺走生命，千刀万剐
唱着哦 哦 哦 哦
她已陷入邪恶深渊，心狠手辣
面对他们杀气腾腾，凶神恶煞
看着她夺走生命，千刀万剐
唱着哦 哦 哦 哦
她宁愿成为猎人而不是猎物
宁愿成为杀手而非圣徒
无论如何她仍会使你祈祷
也许很久以前她生于天堂
但是不慎滑落入人间
现在的她已脱胎换骨
请不要离开
将危险玩弄之间
请不要离开
将危险蹂躏之间
请不要离开
将危险掌股之间
请不要离开
她已陷入邪恶深渊，心狠手辣
面对他们杀气腾腾，凶神恶煞
看着她夺走生命，千刀万剐
唱着哦 哦 哦 哦
她已陷入邪恶深渊，心狠手辣
面对他们杀气腾腾，凶神恶煞
看着她夺走生命，千刀万剐
唱着哦 哦 哦 哦
她已陷入邪恶深渊，心狠手辣
每当我看见他们
我知道我很疯狂  她很疯狂
但我像是生存于它的边缘
我享受疯狂
点燃火柴  让它爆炸
玩弄烟火只是乐趣的一半
不要向任何人展示这个
可是此事因你而起  即无法停止
内心的狂野与邪恶已饥渴难耐
微笑直到恶作剧变得无趣
她不是英雄  而是别人的恶魔
故事直接从掠夺开始
昂首阔步  强装坚强又如何
不  你甚至不在同一类别
但也能让你前所未有地害怕死神
你听着它越来越深  直到她撕裂你的内心
不知为何他们不断地祈求
给予他们生命不过为了再杀一次
最终由镰刀送他们飞回去
这是一种你永远无法理解的快感
请不要离开
将危险玩弄之间
请不要离开
将危险蹂躏之间
请不要离开
将危险掌股之间
请不要离开
她已陷入邪恶深渊，心狠手辣
面对他们杀气腾腾，凶神恶煞
看着她夺走生命，千刀万剐
唱着哦 哦 哦 哦
她已陷入邪恶深渊，心狠手辣
面对他们杀气腾腾，凶神恶煞
看着她夺走生命，千刀万剐
唱着哦 哦 哦 哦
