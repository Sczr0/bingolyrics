Null.No light after dawn
Wind carrying a low tone
I can't recognize anymore
A colourless fall
Concealing what was known
From the place where time won't atone
Now, the thoughts keep to linger on
The petals wilting
And the image cease to glow
This river that once flowed
Shows a reflection that's flawed
The true form, that now is gone
Null.A glim after dawn
Wind carrying a new tone
I can recognize after all
A new colour shown
Revealing the unknown
From the place that time won't atone
A light after dawn
The time has come
To accept the fall
And let go of what's gone
From the mist, a new image is formed
Once again
this river flows
The endless existence keeps waving on
A new memory. A new sound
A new light through this lifeless void world
A new shape of the reflections of myself
My true colours. My new chime
Keeping what was distant in the prism of light
Merging what is new with what thought gone
And carry on
The memory once gone
Instead
Carrying on
A new image was shown
Through the mist
I carry on
昏暗的黎明没有光芒
风带着低沉的音调
我再也无法认出
无色之秋
掩盖着未知之物
从时间无法弥补的地方
现在，思绪徘徊
花瓣枯萎
回忆已然黯淡
曾经流过的河
显现出一副残破的倒影
真实的模样现已经消失
黎明后的微光
风带着清新的音调
我终究能认出
新的色彩已然绽放
揭露出未知之物
从时间无法弥补的地方
黎明后的曙光
时间已然到来
接受秋天
放下已然逝去之物
从薄雾中，一副崭新的记忆形成
再一次
河水重新流动
无尽的生命继续挥手
新之忆，新之声
新的光芒穿过寂灭虚无的世界
我的倒影再次被塑形
本色再现，时钟新鸣
遥远之物封存在光的棱镜中
融合着新事物与旧观念
继续前行
记忆已然逝去
取而代之的是
继续前行
新的记忆已然呈现
透过薄雾
我继续前行
