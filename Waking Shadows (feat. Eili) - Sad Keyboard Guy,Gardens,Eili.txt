Null.No light after dawn
昏暗的黎明没有光芒
Wind carrying a low tone
风带着低沉的音调
I can't recognize anymore
我再也无法认出
A colourless fall
无色之秋
Concealing what was known
掩盖着未知之物
From the place where time won't atone
从时间无法弥补的地方
Now, the thoughts keep to linger on
现在，思绪徘徊
The petals wilting
花瓣枯萎
And the image cease to glow
回忆已然黯淡
This river that once flowed
曾经流过的河
Shows a reflection that's flawed
显现出一副残破的倒影
The true form, that now is gone
真实的模样现已经消失
Null.A glim after dawn
黎明后的微光
Wind carrying a new tone
风带着清新的音调
I can recognize after all
我终究能认出
A new colour shown
新的色彩已然绽放
Revealing the unknown
揭露出未知之物
From the place that time won't atone
从时间无法弥补的地方
A light after dawn
黎明后的曙光
The time has come
时间已然到来
To accept the fall
接受秋天
And let go of what's gone
放下已然逝去之物
From the mist, a new image is formed
从薄雾中，一副崭新的记忆形成
Once again
再一次
this river flows
河水重新流动
The endless existence keeps waving on
无尽的生命继续挥手
A new memory. A new sound
新之忆，新之声
A new light through this lifeless void world
新的光芒穿过寂灭虚无的世界
A new shape of the reflections of myself
我的倒影再次被塑形
My true colours. My new chime
本色再现，时钟新鸣
Keeping what was distant in the prism of light
遥远之物封存在光的棱镜中
Merging what is new with what thought gone
融合着新事物与旧观念
And carry on
继续前行
The memory once gone
记忆已然逝去
Instead
取而代之的是
Carrying on
继续前行
A new image was shown
新的记忆已然呈现
Through the mist
透过薄雾
I carry on
我继续前行
