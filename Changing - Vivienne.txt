I can hear, I can hear, I can hear you.
Can we close, can we close, can we close this so-called distance?
How do I know you're near when you sometimes disappear?
I'm falling apart, I can't sense your heart, and nothing is clear.
So long to the past and the winter air.
I'm no longer caught in the darkness.
It has cleared away and now I see you there.
Somewhere out there, the beginning,
Everything may not make sense at first until we try.
Give this a chance so that once more
I can cherish you until the end of time.
I am changing each and every day,
But remaining is the warmth you gave.
Can you hear, can you hear, can you hear me?
Let yourself, let yourself, let yourself control the distance.
Do you feel when I'm near when you sometimes disappear?
You're falling apart and closing your heart, when I am right here.
So long to the past and the winter air.
You're no longer caught in the darkness.
It will clear away and you'll see again.
So long to the past and the winter air.
I'm no longer caught in the darkness.
It has cleared away and now I see you there.
Somewhere out there, you are fading.
Everything may not make sense at first until you try.
Give it a chance so that once more.
You'll no longer be alone to hurt this time.
I am changing each and every day,
But remaining is the warmth you gave.
You are changing each and every day,
But remaining is the warmth you saved.
So long to the past and the winter air.
You're no longer caught in the darkness.
It will clear away and you'll see again.
So long to the past and the winter air.
I'm no longer caught in the darkness.
It has cleared away and now I see you there.
Somewhere out there, the beginning,

I can cherish you until the end of time.
I am changing each and every day,
But remaining is the warmth you gave.
You are changing each and every day,
But remaining is the warmth you saved.
我能听见你的声音，这般真切
我们何不，去跨越彼此间虚无的沟壑
你不经意间的消失，让我不知所措
逐渐支离破碎，周身陷入混沌，再无法触及你的内心
凛冬的空气，连结起过去的回忆
不再迷失于无尽黑夜
曙光的前方，便是你的身影
故事的开端，就在某处
唯有尝试的勇气才能指引前进的方向
给予一次机会，这一次我定将
与心爱的你共行至时间尽头
光怪陆离，千变万化的日常之中
亘古不变的唯有你给予的温暖
你能否听见我的声音，一如往昔
伸出你的双手，越过彼此间的沟壑
从我身边不辞而别的你，是否感受到我的存在
你的内心逐渐支离破碎，纵使我就近在眼前
凛冬的空气，连结起过去的回忆
你将不再迷失于无尽黑夜
曙光的前方，我们将再次相遇
凛冬的空气，唤醒了过去的回忆
我已不再迷失于无尽黑夜
曙光的前方，便有着你的身影
某处的角落，你的背影渐渐模糊
唯有尝试的勇气才能指引前进的方向
给予一次机会，我会攥紧手心
这一次，你将不再孤身一人承受痛苦
光怪陆离，千变万化的日常之中
亘古不变的唯有你给予的温暖
分别的时光改变了你的模样
不变的是你捧在手心的温暖
凛冬的空气，连结起过去的回忆
你将不再迷失于无尽黑夜
曙光的前方，我们将再次相遇
凛冬的空气，连结起过去的回忆
不再迷失于无尽黑夜
曙光的前方，便是你的身影
故事的开端，就在某处
唯有尝试的勇气才能指引前进的方向
给予一次机会，这一次我将
与心爱的你共行至时间尽头
光怪陆离，千变万化的日常之中
亘古不变的唯有你给予的温暖
分别的时光改变了你的模样
不变的是你捧在手心的温暖
