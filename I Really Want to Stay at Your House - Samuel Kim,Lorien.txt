I couldn't wait for you to come clear the cupboards
But now you're going to leave with nothing but a sign
Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines
Because I miss you all the time
So, get away
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
Let's start at the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
Let yourself go
Is that a compromise
So what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view
There's a party soon, do you wanna go
A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hope this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know
And I'm aware that you were lying in the gutter
'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide
So when you tell me I'm the reason I just can't believe the lies
And why do I so want to call you
So what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view
There's a party soon, do you wanna go
A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hope this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know
You
Oh-oh-oh
I don't know why I'm no-one
So, get away
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
Let's start at the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
Let yourself go
Is that a compromise
So what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view
There's a party soon, do you wanna go
A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hope this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know
我等不及你来清理这橱柜
但如今你离去 只留下一处标记
又一个夜晚 我静坐品味你言外之意
因为我却时刻思念着你
所以 那就离开吧
只为让自己不愿了解真相
放任你自己走吧
你深知 你并未失去自制力
让我们于彩虹之上开始
拒绝内心纷扰
只为让自己不愿继续前行
放任你自己走吧
这是否等于妥协了呢
所以你想做什么呢 说出你的观点
这里有场狂欢派对 你是否想去呢
同你握手 询问你的看法
我全心倾覆于你 不愿离去
因为我真的想要呆在你家里
多希望能一直呆着
但你知道 你令我内心多么分崩离析
我已经受够你了 我要将你忽视
我不想再了解了
我意识到 你深陷于恶劣环境中
因为我已竭尽全力 只为陪伴你身旁
所以当你告诉我 我就是其中的原因时 对于这些谎言 我简直难以置信
为何我这么想给你打电话
所以你想做什么呢 说出你的观点
这里有场狂欢派对 你是否想去呢
同你握手 询问你的看法
我全心倾覆于你 不愿离去
因为我真的想要呆在你家里
我希望这一切都会成功
但你知道 你令我内心多么分崩离析
我已经受够你了 我要将你忽视
我不想再了解了
You
Oh-oh-oh
我不知为何 自己的内心犹如沉溺水下
所以 那就离开吧
只为让自己不愿了解真相
放任你自己走吧
你深知 你并未失去自制力
让我们于彩虹之上开始
拒绝内心纷扰
只为让自己不愿继续前行
放任你自己走吧
这是否等于妥协了呢
所以你想做什么呢 说出你的观点
这里有场狂欢派对 你是否想去呢
同你握手 询问你的看法
我全心倾覆于你 不愿离去
因为我真的想要呆在你家里
我希望这一切都会成功
但你知道 你令我内心多么分崩离析
我已经受够你了 我要将你忽视
我不想再了解了
