Corrupt binary codes infecting my mind
perform invocation with numbing freeze.
Querying for a variable and seizing the time
to recompile and trigger my destiny.
Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid.
I'll try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed.
There is no "exception" in this library
for I know I will always go with you.
Superhot projectiles pierce the wind.
I charged up my armor into lightspeed
Querying for a variable and seizing the time
in a new day coming not so far away.
Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid.
I'll try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed.
There is no "exception" in this library
for I know I will always go with you.
Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid.
I'll try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed.
There is no "exception" in this library
for I know I will always go with you.
Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid,
I'll try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed.
There is no "exception" in this library
for I know I will always go with my heart.
错乱的代码侵蚀着意识
麻木冰冷地执行调用
查询一个变量并绑定时间
去重新编译、触发命运
即使双翼早已溅上无法洗净的血污
为了梦中彼岸，我也要全力飞翔
这个库不会报出“异常”
因为我知道，我永远会与你同行
炽热的弹头撕裂疾风
我为战甲充能，直至飞驰如光
查询一个变量并绑定时间
在全新而不遥远的未来
即使双翼早已溅上无法洗净的血污
为了梦中彼岸，我要全力飞翔
这个库不会报出“异常”
因为我知道，我永远会与你同行
即使双翼早已溅上无法摆脱的血污
为了梦中彼岸，我要全力飞翔
这个库不会报出“异常”
因为我知道，我永远会与你同行
即使双翼早已溅上无法摆脱的血污
为了梦中彼岸，我要全力飞翔
这个库不会报出“异常”
因为我知道，我永远会与心同行
