I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around and say
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
Too late
Oh oh
I'd take another chance take a fall
Take a shot for you
Oh oh
I need you like a heart
Needs a beat
But it's nothing new
Yeah yeah
I loved you with the fire red
Now it's turning blue and you say
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
Oh
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize yeah
I said it's too late to apologize yeah
I'm holding on your rope got me ten feet off the ground
此时我正紧握你所给予的爱与希望
能让我得到救赎离开这破败之墟的爱啊
我能清楚认知到你所说的话语啊
可我又该如何作出回复
你一面说着你有多么依赖我
一面轻飘飘转身离去
放任我一人坠入深渊苦苦等待不知所措
你向我诉说你的歉意
从未料想我会对你默然相诉
不用再做无谓的道歉了
我并不会再在意
我说我已经无感了
就这样算了吧
算了吧
但我又怎么欺骗得了自己呢
如果你再次向我伸出手
我还是会选择和你坠入爱河啊
这才是我的本心啊
我视你为我生命中不可或缺之人
仅仅是想得到些许爱的回应
但这仅仅是我的奢求
你对我的爱还是那样无动于衷
我那时是那么热烈又真诚地爱着你啊
可现在也只能任其消亡殆尽
你冷静地说着抱歉的模样
在我眼中也是如此像天使般让人难挑瑕疵
你知道我怕什么吗
我怕你的道歉来的太迟
那时我就无法再接受了
可你的道歉总是在我心灰意冷之时才来啊
这样的时差我该怎么接受
宝贝
你的道歉来的太迟了
太迟了
我该如何如何
再接受你迟来的道歉啊
别让我等太久你的道歉
拜托了啊
我会顺着你给的台阶离开这深渊。
