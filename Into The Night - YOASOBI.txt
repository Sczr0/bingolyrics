Seize a move, you're on me, falling, and we were dissolving
You and me, skies above and wide, it brings on the true night on me
All I could feel was a goodbye
Those only words you wrote, it's plenty to understand ya
The sun is going down, the sky behind and visions of you would stand
Overlapping with you and the fence beyond
Remember the night that we met up
Broke into me and taken everything left in my heart
So fragile is that air, it always keeps on revolving near and wide
Loneliness envelops deep in your eyes
It's stuck in tick-and-tocking mode
Never refraining shamble, block of sound
Too many terrible noises around
And the voice ringing in me gets louder
With tears about to fall
I need to find me an average happy tiptoe
Locating, never tough when I'm with you
Saw what got seen hid beneath, and louder nights keep beating
I'm going to you, and giving brighter shiny tomorrows
What can "night" for you mean, infinite? You could run with me
Place your hand in mine, you gotta stay, hold up
Want to leave it behind, dark cruel days, in deep, you may have hid before
I'm embracing you until more heat dissolve what is caught up
Sun will soon rise up into a day you're no more too afraid
Keep all of me in you
Only perceiving through your eyes
I see nothing, I'll soon hate you, keep me out, I'm crying out
You're falling into deeper fascination, giving away your love
That expression has got me crying out
She's gonna try to me, she's gonna lie
Got to force a belief and trust to keep on
Every time it happens, heap of attack, and now I'm back in
I got to cry, then who knows?
So we gotta keep on
If you gotta keep on
Then we're gonna keep on
One day, we will understand, I'm believing in you
"No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking"
As I show my needs, I reach to get back on, still not fit in
You free my hand, then leave it
"No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking"
Never told you the truth, I'm feeling that inside
Back for another "tick-and-tocking" mode
Never refraining shamble, block of sound
Killing, oh, too many words that I gathered around
Won't let me go to your mind
"I want it to be done" is what went out
It found a way to finally leak out of me
And for once, I could make you let out a smile
Saw what got seen hid beneath, and louder nights are keeping me down
My new images of you, now, appear heavenly now
What can "night" for you mean when fallen seas of tears are gone
They dissolve into the peace inside of you
Calling to life, hit beneath, crying days in the eternal
Give me what I saw in you, oh, what an end to stop all
Seize a move, you're on me, falling and we were dissolving
See me to it, fog is leaving, bright air move
Want to leave it behind, tucked all days away, forget, and hid beneath
Hand in hand, extend to me, that let me know beyond falls
Through the seas of beyond, so loud and blows you afloat in the sky
New wind moving into you
Tonight, don't ever lose sight of me and let go
You and me are running through the night in dark, I'll take you
就是在你爱上我的那一刻，我们正在沉溺融化啊
在只有你和我的广阔天空之下，奔向黑夜
我能感觉到的是一场告别
你写的只言片语就足以让我明白一切
日落时分的天空与你站立的倒影
与栅栏边缘相互交叠
还记得我们相遇的那个夜晚吗
你闯入我夺走我内心的一切
被缥缈烟缊缠绕的你
眼神中却有如此深沉的寂寞
在时钟不停转动的世界中
抛开声音永不停歇地摇晃
周围残酷的噪音太刺耳
触动我内心之声时
就快要潸然泪下了啊
我想找到平凡愉快的一点点
只当我和你在一起的时候
看到跳动着的被藏匿的响彻夜晚了吗
我要奔向你啊，为你献上一切光明的闪耀明天
夜对于你意味着无限吗？你可以和我一起跑啊
抓住我的手吧，和我一起留下来吧
把你躲藏的黑暗残酷的日子抛之脑后
让我拥抱你的热量将它融化
黎明很快就要降临啦，别再害怕啦
紧紧相依吧
只能通过你的眼睛感知
讨厌我所不能看见的一切
讨厌看见的你坠入爱河一般
令我哭泣的表情啊
她尝试倾诉她的谎言
必须强迫自己信任才能继续下去
每次就这样重蹈覆辙
然后在不为人知的地方哭出来了
不过我们要继续下去啊
如果你还想要继续下去的话
我们就会继续下去啊
即便如此，我依然坚信，总有一天我们会心意相通
“不，我疲惫了
