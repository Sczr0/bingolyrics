Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I don't care where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
My life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well its fine by me
So wake me up when its all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when its all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize
So wake me up when its all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when its all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
在黑暗中摸索前行
全凭跳动的心指引
旅途的终点在何方 我并不在意
但我知道该从哪里开始
虽然总是说我太年轻 懵懂无知
沉浸在自我幻想中不出来
如果我还不清醒过来 人生就会稍纵即逝
虽然我觉得没那么糟糕
那不妨在一切结束时 再将我唤醒吧
那时我会更成熟理智
我从未停止过找回真正的自己
但却没发现早就迷失了自我
那不妨在一切结束时 再将我唤醒吧
那时我会更成熟理智
我从未停止过找回真正的自己
但却没发现早就迷失了自我
我有试过承受世界之重
但我只有一双手
希望能有机会遨游全世界
但我没什么计划
真希望能永远年轻
不再害怕闭上双眼
生活不过是场全民游戏
爱是最终的奖励
那不妨在一切结束时 再将我唤醒吧
那时我会更成熟理智
我从未停止过找回真正的自己
但却没发现早就迷失了自我
那不妨在一切结束时 再将我唤醒吧
那时我会更成熟理智
我从未停止过找回真正的自己
但却没发现早就迷失了自我
没发现早就迷失了自我
没发现早就迷失了自我
没发现早就迷失了自我
没发现早就迷失了自我
