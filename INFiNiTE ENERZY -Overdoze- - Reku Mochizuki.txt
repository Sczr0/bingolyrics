Drop the beat
Bar's sold out and the bar's sold bar's sold out
And the drinks keep co-o-o-o-omin'
And no relationships, I ain't lookin' for a wife
But I'll guarantee you'll enjoy your night
Bar's sold out and the drinks keep comin' the drinks keep comin'
Else is try-na-na-na
No relationships, I ain't lookin' for a wife
But everybody else is tryna leave with something
Bar's sold out and the bar's sold bar's sold out
And the drinks keep co-o-o-o-omin'
And no relationships, I ain't lookin' for a wife
But I'll guarantee you'll enjoy your night
Bar's sold out and the drinks keep comin' the drinks keep comin'
Else is try-na-na-na
No relationships, I ain't lookin' for a wife
But everybody else is tryna leave with something
Drinks keep comin' and everybody else is
Drinks keep comin' and everybody else is
Drinks keep comin' and everybody else is
Drinks keep comin' and everybody else..
Bar's sold out and the drinks keep comin'
And everybody else is tryna leave with something
No relationships, I ain't lookin' for a wife but...
