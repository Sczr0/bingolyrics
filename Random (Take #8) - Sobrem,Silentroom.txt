I'm sorry for dragging you all the way
I just hope you didn't think I'm mad or so (for all I've done)
Just take a breath, make yourself
'cause there's something you may not could imagine since you closed your eyes
But it's nothing scary, nothing to be-afraid of
More it's like a taste of a breeze from the south
Might be crunchy in the morning and bright in the night
you can get it, I believe you did?
Now concentrate,
can you listen all the things around your knees?
(to all the things around your knees)
Rabbits hop, waterdrop, whole reflection of yourself
feeling dizzy of the spectacle
Lalalala-lala, life is everchanging
Nananana-nana, not so entertaining, Lata-ta
Nothing to care, nothing to lose and no need to hesitate
*C'mon, which one, which one?*
Beauty of the world you'll gotta love
Joys and wonders on this world
Never to be shy, just smile and hug
