Here I make new meaning over these waters
Consumed and, cut the clear wind as I soar
To flap all wings as fast as I can take
To my city there, let’s go
Soon, beyond this ocean
Yes, I’m a small little swallow, arriving upon a city
There is something that I saw
That’s full of joy, I hear a few voices
And sounds of worry and sorrow of other friends' voices
We all have many different ways to be living lives we are in
Wanting to just protect without a time of noticing
Why are we inflicting this pain on one another
Under the same sky we live in
Brought to the world, every tall and small and all
Many lives of color variety, together, we keep living
With everyone, we people and all the plants, every bird and flower
Shoulder to shoulder just look around
But in the world, things we’re always reaching for
And the new futures we’re looking for are all such different tones
If we’re able to keep going hand in hand
We will be laughing and living together with a smile
I’m thinking of what I can do to make it better now
Back on the other side of fortune that’s taken up by somebody
Friends have lost locations, a place to live and come home to
Only thing he wanted was to harmoniously
Be living here together and just be
Could not see anything, overtaken by sorrow
Shadows almost here to stain darker colors in my soul
When you start to forgive, and accept our differences
We begin to make connection once again
What could it be that we can be doing now
Even if we couldn’t change it all by doing everything we can
Let it be known, to somebody’s day, go on
Bring a little bit of vibrancy in color to their world
We know it’s far from a precious stone so bright
It’s nothing like any fine sheet of gold
But just as how we see, if we could make our world
Start overflowing with a subtle little piece of love
Take notice what surrounds, some changes you will see
Under the same sky we live in, one day it’ll show
So goes the story of small and little me holding a big dream
我在这里的水面上焕发新生
啜饮并逆着清风 翱翔蓝天
尽情挥舞着双翅
让我们一起穿过街道
不久便会越过海洋
是的，我是一只娇小的小燕子 在我所经过的城市
总会见闻到人间烟火
有时听到人们的欢声笑语
有时又会沉浸在同伴们的悲鸣中
尽管我们的生活方式有不一样
想要守护却在不知不觉间
为何又要互相伤害呢
明明生活在同一片天空下啊
无问高低 降生于此
我们都是多姿多彩的生命 在这个地球共同生活着
每个人类 每种草木抑或是花鸟
让我们肩并肩互相依偎在一起
尽管我们所追求的东西
所描绘的未来 各有不同
若能携手互助的话
我们便能在微笑着生活在一起
如今的我又有什么是力所能及的事情呢
而在某些人获得富足的背后
可能是被夺去归宿的同伴
明明他其实也想和大家
和谐生活在一起啊
尽管被悲伤蒙蔽双眼
即使灵魂被染成黑色
当彼此开始宽恕与认同
我们便会重新紧密联系在一起
这就是我们现在能做的事情
尽管这一切不会一下子因此而改变
也将讯息告知众人吧 直至某日
让他们的世界也拥有鲜艳的色彩
我们深知它没有宝石闪闪发光
也并非像金箔般耀眼
若能我们所看见的那样 创造属于我们的世界
也会让这世界洋溢些许爱意
你看向周围吧 总会发现一些变化
我相信总有一天会在这片天空下实现
这是渺小的我的 大大的梦想
