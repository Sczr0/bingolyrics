Here I make new meaning over these waters
我在这里的水面上焕发新生
Consumed and, cut the clear wind as I soar
啜饮并逆着清风 翱翔蓝天
To flap all wings as fast as I can take
尽情挥舞着双翅
To my city there, let’s go
让我们一起穿过街道
Soon, beyond this ocean
不久便会越过海洋
Yes, I’m a small little swallow, arriving upon a city
是的，我是一只娇小的小燕子 在我所经过的城市
There is something that I saw
总会见闻到人间烟火
That’s full of joy, I hear a few voices
有时听到人们的欢声笑语
And sounds of worry and sorrow of other friends' voices
有时又会沉浸在同伴们的悲鸣中
We all have many different ways to be living lives we are in
尽管我们的生活方式有不一样
Wanting to just protect without a time of noticing
想要守护却在不知不觉间
Why are we inflicting this pain on one another
为何又要互相伤害呢
Under the same sky we live in
明明生活在同一片天空下啊
Brought to the world, every tall and small and all
无问高低 降生于此
Many lives of color variety, together, we keep living
我们都是多姿多彩的生命 在这个地球共同生活着
With everyone, we people and all the plants, every bird and flower
每个人类 每种草木抑或是花鸟
Shoulder to shoulder just look around
让我们肩并肩互相依偎在一起
But in the world, things we’re always reaching for
尽管我们所追求的东西
And the new futures we’re looking for are all such different tones
所描绘的未来 各有不同
If we’re able to keep going hand in hand
若能携手互助的话
We will be laughing and living together with a smile
我们便能在微笑着生活在一起
I’m thinking of what I can do to make it better now
如今的我又有什么是力所能及的事情呢
Back on the other side of fortune that’s taken up by somebody
而在某些人获得富足的背后
Friends have lost locations, a place to live and come home to
可能是被夺去归宿的同伴
Only thing he wanted was to harmoniously
明明他其实也想和大家
Be living here together and just be
和谐生活在一起啊
Could not see anything, overtaken by sorrow
尽管被悲伤蒙蔽双眼
Shadows almost here to stain darker colors in my soul
即使灵魂被染成黑色
When you start to forgive, and accept our differences
当彼此开始宽恕与认同
We begin to make connection once again
我们便会重新紧密联系在一起
What could it be that we can be doing now
这就是我们现在能做的事情
Even if we couldn’t change it all by doing everything we can
尽管这一切不会一下子因此而改变
Let it be known, to somebody’s day, go on
也将讯息告知众人吧 直至某日
Bring a little bit of vibrancy in color to their world
让他们的世界也拥有鲜艳的色彩
We know it’s far from a precious stone so bright
我们深知它没有宝石闪闪发光
It’s nothing like any fine sheet of gold
也并非像金箔般耀眼
But just as how we see, if we could make our world
若能我们所看见的那样 创造属于我们的世界
Start overflowing with a subtle little piece of love
也会让这世界洋溢些许爱意
Take notice what surrounds, some changes you will see
你看向周围吧 总会发现一些变化
Under the same sky we live in, one day it’ll show
我相信总有一天会在这片天空下实现
So goes the story of small and little me holding a big dream
这是渺小的我的 大大的梦想
