Longing you, where do I have to go?
Flavor of the place movin' my old memories.
Seeking you, when I should tell my mind?
Attractive impatience binds my fragile heart.
Sun is rising, star is falling, time is passing, leave me alone.
I could not stop in to play for you to get closer to you.
Sky is dawning, city is dusking, wind is running, over there.
Permit me to play all alternative of you.
Searching you, what is making you so sad?
Don't choice easily to be isolation.
Thinking you , why you invest tenderness?
All your voice is reaching me forcefully but sadly.
Sun is rising, star is falling, time is passing, leave me alone.
You play your imitation is beautiful but painful.
Sky is dawning, city is dusking, wind is running, over there.
Show me truth of you only for me, everything.
Moon is setting, cloud is fading, hope is glowing, come together.
Everytime that spent with you is evidence of your hope.
Already don't need act your imitation forcibly.
Original of you is precious and beloved.
思念着你，我该去何方？
这里的景色 唤醒了曾经的记忆
寻找着你，我该何时诉说自己的愿望？
诱人的躁动 牵动着我脆弱的心
太阳在升起，星星在坠落，时间在流逝，不要再管我
我将不能再停下和你玩耍 你要接近自己梦想
天空破晓，夜幕降临，追逐着风，直到天边
请允许我先将为你做出选择
寻找着你，是什么让你流下泪水？
不要让孤独陪在你的身边
思念着你，是什么让你伸出援手？
我听到了所有你的大声呼喊，但又如此的悲哀
太阳在升起，星星在坠落，时间在流逝，不要再管我
你模仿我的样子很好看，但又如此的痛苦
天空破晓，夜幕降临，追逐着风，直到天边
向我展示你为我的付出，所有的一切
月亮正落下，乌云正消逝，希望正闪烁，到我身边来
和你度过的每一秒，都是你期望的证明
不必再勉强，不必再表演，保持着自我就好
请爱与珍惜着最初的你
