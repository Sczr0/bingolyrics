Full force heart attack
5 point punch don't hold me back
We see through you like it's glass
All you ****** ******* trash
You're not that savage or ruthless, no
Quiver with fear when you step to the goat
They gon' force me to loses my control
****** ain't ready to walk down that road, what
**** this whole scene man we taking **** over
I've been doing business I've been with the olders
It's too late for ****** the dead line is closer
The world has been don't you see I'm the owner, yah
We on that ultra light beam, yah
We 'bout that money and cream, yah
I **** you ***** to my beats, yah
I like the way that she screams, yah
Little ***** doing bits, dropping tracks for the hell of it
Never been indefinite im the master of the evidence
Run up on ***** I turn to john which im a nemesis
Pull up on the trigger and do the venomous negative
I'm so down and aggressive
I run around with the weapon
I'm tripping out on the drugs
I'm bout to break me a record
I'll knock your teeth like dentist
I broke her heart don't regret it
I'm like Dennis the menace
Oh my my my flow is stupendous
Keep my ******* name out your mouth you don't know me
You just hear the **** out my mouth, listen closely
Everything I spit is hot **** and unholy
***** ****** never seen a clip they're so phoney

I see hell inside your face
That **** fills me up with rage
Passing points we shouldn't break
Scarlxrds really bout to change
From that rail card to the range
On some upgrade life exchange
I break down and recreate
