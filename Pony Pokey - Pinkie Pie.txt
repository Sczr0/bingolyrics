You reach your right hoof in
你伸出右前蹄
You reach your right hoof out
你收回右前蹄
You reach your right hoof in
你伸出右前蹄
And you shake it all about
然后摇啊摇啊摇
You do the Pony Pokey meeting lots of folks with clout
你跳起小马转圈舞 见到很多大人物
That's what I'm talking about
跟我来一起跳
You step your left hoof in
你伸出左前蹄
You pull it right back out
你收回左前蹄
You step your left hoof in
你踏出左前蹄
But you better help him out
可你最好帮助他
You do the Pony Pokey but you'd find a different route
跳起小马转圈舞 可舞伴不同了
That's what it's all about
跟我来一起跳
You kick your back leg in
你踢出左后腿
You pull your back leg out
你收回左后腿
You reach your back leg in
你再伸出左后腿
Just be brave and have no doubt
勇敢别怀疑
You do the Pony Pokey feeling like you're gonna pout
你跳起小马转圈舞 嘴巴撅起来
That's what I'm singing about
跟我来一起跳
You tilt your head in
你往左歪歪头
You tilt your head out
你往右歪歪头
You tilt your head in
你往左歪歪头
Then you shake it all about
然后摇啊摇啊摇
You do the Pony Pokey even though your date's a lout
你跳起小马转圈舞 虽然爱情落空了
You're better off without
没有他你会更好
You stomp your whole self in
你这儿扑一扑
You stomp your whole self out
你那儿跳一跳
You stomp your whole self in
你东奔又西跑
And you stomp yourself about
气得直跺脚
You do the Pony Pokey and you give a little shout
你跳起小马转圈舞 心情好糟糕
That's what I'm talking about
跟我来一起跳
You do the Pony Pokey
你跳起小马转圈舞
You do the Pony Pokey
跳起小马转圈舞
You do the Pony Pokey
跳起小马转圈舞
And that's what it's all about
跟我来一起跳
YEAH!
