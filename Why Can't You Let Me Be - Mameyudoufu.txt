[Verse]
Time will only tell
If you'll be on my side
I was under your spell
But I'mma be alright
You only call me when you want me
But you never even said you're sorry
I'm not thinking that you are the one
'Cause all of these emotions got me comin' undone
[Chorus]
What do you want from me?
What do you, what do you want from me, huh?
Why can't you let me be?
Why can't you, why can't you let me be, huh?
[Verse]
Time will only tell
If you'll be on my side
I was under your spell
But I'mma be alright
You only call me when you want me
But you nеver even said you'rе sorry
I'm not thinking that you are the one
'Cause all of these emotions got me comin' undone
[Bridge]
What do you, what do you want from me, huh?
Why can't you, why can't you let me be, huh?
Why can't you, why can't you let me be, huh?

时间会证明一切的吧
如果你与我一同的话
我痴迷于你
但我应该会没事的
你只有在需要我的时候才会致电于我
但你从来没有像我说过道歉的话
我不认为你是我的真命天子
因为积攒的情绪让我崩溃
你想从我这里得到什么？
你想从我这里得到什么，嗯？
你为什么就不能放过我呢？
你为什么就不能放过我呢，嗯？
时间会证明一切的吧
如果你与我一同的话
我痴迷于你

你只是在需要我的时候打给我电话
但我从未听过你说抱歉
你为什么就不能放过我呢？
你为什么就不能放过我呢，嗯？
