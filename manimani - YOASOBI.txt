Lone, unknown, I'm moving on through the night seams
I could view and espy, on a train wavering
Flowing on and moving backwards was a scenery
And so lonely, I watched it as I sat
As I sat
The early afternoon sun in the sky up above is stained by an orange hue
And I set eyes on the growing indigo, it's crushing that sunset view
I kept track of the final light that I pursued
My eyes chased it as if I were lamenting
Today's bye-bye, that is why
I step out to cast away tomorrow, and leap, dashing out to escape it all
Got to keep on moving until I reach where my one-way ticket can go
Don't even have a place where I belong
Nowhere that I'd call home
Now, in the night, oh, just leave me there
Oh, leave me there
Suddenly, I recognize out the window an unlighted scenery
And into sight, I noticed in the dark the ocean has appeared
Decided on a whim
There, I got off, arriving at a town beside the sea
Wave sounds were echoing as to guide me
As I'm walking, they lead
It's almost like somebody calling, drawing me near
I got closer
The ocean, wide and clear
And no one could interfere
So, forevermore, I will leave my body over here
And while I was thinking it all over
In front of me then, out of the blue
Oh, there you were
Right under the moonlight tonight
Your skin so pale and so light
Wearing a white one-piece in view
Tell me why you came and what you hope to see?
Question unforeseen, was a surprise to me
So, at a loss for words, came out of me
"To observe... the sea"
You took out something I did not get to see yet
And then showed me one slightly old firework set
I observed as she was standing over the concrete
And saw her feet, and there, barefoot she was
Oh, today is the day I have decided I'd end it all, that's why
I'm sure that I have come closer to that realm in that moment
And it's why I managed to catch sight of you
We met on that night
So, it's just me and you, in this place
The fireworks, we took them out
Now got, now got
Heating flames a little bit nearer, they do not seem to ignite
You figured the cause I came to be in this area
Assessed and guessed it right
Then you said I should not proceed with it repeatedly
And showed a serious look as you spoke it out
I know, but...
So, all at once, right in front of our hands
A spark has suddenly lit up
Naturally, we both got together and started yelling
"Oh, look, it lit up!"
With a gleaming light as bright as ever
The fireworks were burning as a sharp sound kept ringing out
Kept ringing out
You could see the light fading so fast
We couldn't keep up and take time to watch it slow
Though not wanting to waste it, followed it until it fully blended with the night
In the train, when I was looking out of that window
Saw that final sun, had those same regrets inside
Went after that light
Yeah, I'm thinking...
Actually
When tonight is over, and the dark subsides
Somewhere far, will you then vanish way beyond the tides
Running from the night veil of complete darkness
I woke up to shining rays of morning brightness
Next to me, I took a look, and as if it were the most normal thing
You're there, sleeping by my side
孤身一人 茫然无知 我穿行于黑夜的间隙之中
在晃晃悠悠的列车上 我可以欣赏风景
窗外的景色不断往身后飞驰
我坐在那里 孤独地眺望着
我坐在那里
午后时分 天际的阳光被染上夕阳的橙色
我的目光停留于逐渐扩散那抹靛蓝 吞噬着绚烂的落日余晖
我跟随着我追寻的最后一缕天光
我的目光紧追不放 仿佛我在轻声叹息
今天也要说再见了 而这就是原因
为了舍弃明天 我走出家门 踏上逃亡之旅
我必须一往无前 直到我抵达我这张单程票可以去的地方
我甚至无法拥有栖身之所
在这世上 我找不到可以称之为家的地方
此刻身处黑夜之中 就让我留在原地吧
让我留在原地吧
突然之间 我意识到窗外是一片漆黑的景色
我注意到黑暗笼罩的海洋浮现在视线里
一时心血来潮
我走下列车 来到一座海边小镇
涛声回荡在耳畔 为我指引方向
我缓步前行 它们在前引路
就好像有人发出呼唤 吸引我慢慢靠近海边
我越走越近
这片大海一望无垠 海水清澈
无人可以打扰
所以我会让自己永远徜徉于此
在我陷入沉思之际
突然之间你出现
在我面前
今晚沐浴着皎洁的月光
你的肌肤雪白又细腻
穿着一身洁白的连衣裙
告诉我你为何而来 你希望看到什么
无可预料的问题令我大吃一惊
一时之间 我无言以对
只能说一句“过来欣赏大海”
你拿出一些我还没有见过的东西
让我看见一套略显陈旧的烟花
我发现站在混凝土地面上的她
我看到她赤裸的双脚
就在今天 我已决定结束这一切 这是因为
我确信在那一刻 我愈发靠近那美妙的境界
这就是我的目光注定落在你身上的原因
那天晚上 我们邂逅彼此
所以只有我和你在这个地方
我们一起拆开烟花
此时此刻
我把炙热的火焰再凑近一些 因为这烟花似乎难以点燃
你思索着我来到这个地方的理由
你的猜测准确无误
你反复劝说我不应该来这里
在你坦白说出口的时候 你神情严肃
我心知肚明 但是
一切在我们触手可及的范围内
引线突然被点燃
我们不约而同地开始一起呐喊
看呀 点燃啦
闪烁的光芒如从前一般璀璨夺目
烟花肆意燃烧 刺耳的锐响不断回荡在空中
不断回荡在空中
你可以看见那灿烂的光芒转瞬即逝
尽管我们还来不及花些时间慢慢欣赏
虽然不想浪费时间 目光追随着烟花 直到一切彻底融入夜色之中
在列车上 当我眺望着窗外
凝视着最后的太阳 同样的遗憾袭上心头
追寻着那道光芒
我思索着
事实上
当今夜结束 黑暗褪去
你会慢慢走向遥远的地方 消失于潮汐之间
逃离黑夜的帷幕
我会在明媚的晨曦中醒来
我看着依偎我身旁的人 仿佛这是再正常不过的事情
你在我身边酣睡正香
