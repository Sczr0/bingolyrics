[By:HLSNCATI]
Living in a crowded dream
Searching for the quiet that you need to breathe
Gave up on your sanity to hide behind your shadow
While you tried to take the sun down
Hearts will never change to gold
Out there thinking that you're in the world alone
No one ever told you that you'll have to fight for something
Or you'll never learn to balance
It's too cold
Standing in the middle of the downpour
Looking in the mirror 'cause it's only you
That you have to lose
Headed backward on a one-way
Trying to stop from running but you can't wait
Bury all the evidence, you'll only learn
When you crash and burn
Red light
Oh oh
Red light
Em em
Red light
Oh oh
Red light
Em em
(Chorus)
Living in a crazy world
Following the path that always twists and turns
Gave up on your sanity to hide behind the devil
'Cause you think you'll live forever
Say you're never getting old
Out there thinking that you're in the world alone
No-one ever told you that you have to live for something
Or in the end, you will be nothing
It's too cold
Standing in the middle of the downpour
Looking in the mirror 'cause it's only you
That you have to lose
Headed backward on a one-way
Trying to stop from running but you can't wait
Bury all the evidence, you'll only learn
When you crash and burn
Red light
Oh oh
Red light
Em em
Red light
Oh oh
Red light
Em em
(Chorus)
