All alone again as he walks the empty path
Searching for the place that he's seen inside his dreams
Desperately he tries to find a way to quench his thirst
As the memories begin to slip away
Losing sense of time as he walks the endless path
Never knowing if he'll reach the place inside his dreams
Picking up the scattered pieces of his broken heart
But the answer always seems so far away
He tosses and he turns again
Throughout the night to ease the pain
The laughter dies inside head
Only tears remain
And within the moment inside his dream
He's finding it harder to breathe
Let us stand upon this barren path and look to the sky
Let our voices be heard sing the song of our life
And the weight of the words echoing now in the deep abyss inside
It's the sound that keeps me alive
All alone again as he walks the empty path
Searching for the place that he's seen inside his dreams
Desperately he tries find a way to catch his breath
As the fleeting visions start to melt away
The only sound that fills the air
Is the lonely rhythm of his heart
And the faces so familiar
Were no longer there
And yet in this moment inside of his heart
He's finding the answer he needs
Let us stand upon this barren path and look to the sky
Let our voices be heard sing the song of our life
And the sound of our steps echoing now from the deep abyss inside
It's the sound that keeps me alive
Yeah
他再次孤身踏上那条无人之路
寻找着他曾在梦中见到的地方
绝望地想找到解渴的办法
所有的记忆开始随风消散
他走在这条仿佛无尽的路上，不知现在已是何年何月
也不知他是否会到达梦中的那个地方
拾捡起他破碎心灵的碎片
但那个答案似乎总是那么遥不可及
抛出硬币，他再次回转
穿越茫茫黑夜只为心中的痛苦能够平息
他从此成了不会笑的人
眼中只留泪水
在他梦中的时刻
他发现自己就要窒息
从这贫瘠的土地上站起，仰望广阔的蓝天
唱出你我的生命之歌，让我们的声音能被听见
这些话语现在在那深深的峡谷中不停回响
就是这个声音让我能够存活下来
他再次孤身踏上那条无人之路
寻找着他曾在梦中见到的地方
绝望地想找到解渴的办法
所有的景像开始在眼前消散
万籁俱寂
只剩他的心跳那孤单的节奏
这些面孔是如此熟悉
却再也不复存在
此时在他的心中
他已找到了需要的那个答案
从这贫瘠的土地上站起，仰望广阔的蓝天
唱出你我的生命之歌，让我们的声音能被听见
这些话语现在在那深深的峡谷中不停回响
就是这个声音让我能够存活下来
