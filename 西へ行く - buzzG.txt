All alone again as he walks the empty path

Searching for the place that he's seen inside his dreams

Desperately he tries to find a way to quench his thirst

As the memories begin to slip away
所有的记忆开始随风消散
Losing sense of time as he walks the endless path
他走在这条仿佛无尽的路上，不知现在已是何年何月
Never knowing if he'll reach the place inside his dreams
也不知他是否会到达梦中的那个地方
Picking up the scattered pieces of his broken heart

But the answer always seems so far away

He tosses and he turns again
抛出硬币，他再次回转
Throughout the night to ease the pain
穿越茫茫黑夜只为心中的痛苦能够平息
The laughter dies inside head
他从此成了不会笑的人
Only tears remain
眼中只留泪水
And within the moment inside his dream
在他梦中的时刻
He's finding it harder to breathe

Let us stand upon this barren path and look to the sky
从这贫瘠的土地上站起，仰望广阔的蓝天
Let our voices be heard sing the song of our life
唱出你我的生命之歌，让我们的声音能被听见
And the weight of the words echoing now in the deep abyss inside
这些话语现在在那深深的峡谷中不停回响
It's the sound that keeps me alive
就是这个声音让我能够存活下来
All alone again as he walks the empty path

Searching for the place that he's seen inside his dreams
寻找着他曾在梦中见到的地方
Desperately he tries find a way to catch his breath
绝望地想找到解渴的办法
As the fleeting visions start to melt away
所有的景像开始在眼前消散
The only sound that fills the air
万籁俱寂
Is the lonely rhythm of his heart
只剩他的心跳那孤单的节奏
And the faces so familiar
这些面孔是如此熟悉
Were no longer there
却再也不复存在
And yet in this moment inside of his heart
此时在他的心中
He's finding the answer he needs

Let us stand upon this barren path and look to the sky
从这贫瘠的土地上站起，仰望广阔的蓝天
Let our voices be heard sing the song of our life
唱出你我的生命之歌，让我们的声音能被听见
And the sound of our steps echoing now from the deep abyss inside
这些话语现在在那深深的峡谷中不停回响
It's the sound that keeps me alive
