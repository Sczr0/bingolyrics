The lights were everywhere and I stood by the crash
They told me if I stayed that I would never forget
But you were in there; tell me, how could I want that?
So I stood right there; they couldn't force me back
because no one can hold me back but myself
If I can do this without you, I don't need their help
The time we waste; can't get it back
The faith we lose; can't get it back
Can't get it back
And every day I see him in the mirror
I want to crush his heart, I want to break his jaw
Cause neither of us deserve to be where we are
Cause neither of us deserve to be where we are
I never failed anyone as hard as I failed you
And let's be honest, I don't deserve any better
No I don't
The time we waste; can't get it back
The faith we lose; can't get it back
Can't get it back
When your faith looks a lot like fear
When your faith looks a lot like fear
When your fear looks a lot like guilt
So don't tell me my faith isn't there
Don't tell me
The time we waste; can't get it back
The faith we lose; can't get it back
Can't get it back
We're going to spend years doing this
In a place where we're too small
to read the words that tell us who we are
We blindfold our own eyes
we reach in the dark for one another
So desperate
we shake each other hard enough to kill
Will you see god?
四处都是明亮，我却陷入破裂的边缘
他们告诉我如果我在这里会令我难忘
但是你站在那，请告诉我该怎么做
我就在原地他们也奈不了我何
除了我自己没人能麻痹我
如果没有你我也能做到，那他们屁都不是
我们浪费的时间不能收回
我们失去的信心也不能重拾
拿不回来
每天在镜子里看到他该死的面孔
我就想毁了他的心打碎他的下巴
因为我们两个不该待在原地
因为我们两个不该待在原地
我从来没像你一样让人失望
说句实话，我根本不配得到更好的
我不配！
我们浪费的时间不能收回
我们失去的信心也不能重拾
拿不回来
当你的信仰看起来像恐惧
当你的信仰看起来像魔鬼一般
当你的恐惧看起来像是内疚一样
别告诉我我的信仰它不存在
闭上嘴
我们浪费的时间不能收回
我们失去的信心也不能重拾
拿不回来
日复一日 年复一年
在这个我们跟蝼蚁一般的地方
去理解那些告诉我们我们是谁的话
我们蒙蔽着自己的双眼
在黑暗中相互扶持挣扎着
从来没有这么绝望过！
我们互相挥舞的力气足以杀了一个人
我们一遍又一遍继续重复着同一个问题
你能见到你的上帝吗？
