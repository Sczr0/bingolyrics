Ah, like every day I see
Another day repeats, I’m yawning all the time
After all the cheers, the night, it fades out and
Shibuya receives a pour of the morning light
And somehow, an emptiness surrounds
That’s what I always feel
Something is not enough
That’s how it’s gonna be
It’s all a part of life
I’ll let this be
See what, see what, covered deep inside
Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on
Pretending won’t bring it out of sight
It is always waiting there for you
Calling followed, what I feel’s to be drawn
Going by my selection in this color, then
Suddenly, with the breeze of a drowsy morning
There was a world of blue shown in front of me
Liking what you believe in and saying that you do
Can be too terrifying, but I know
I’ve finally come across a true discovery of what I got
Ah, the more that I reach out my hands to what I need
The further it becomes
Another one of these unruly days go on
I’m always in a hurry as I’m struggling
Misery, stemming from all my thoughts
Humiliation brings new tears into my view
The more that I step in, the harder it becomes
Even the pain renews
Calling followed, what I feel is the move
Going by my selection in this path I walk
On a night fighting off eyelids dropping heavy
I’m grabbing tight, the blue vow in front of me
Taking what you believe and to keep doing so
Every step’s not only fun all the time
Don’t know if I’m able, cause I am worried a little
Ah, “one line” was drawn
Every “one line” was drawn
Missing inner confidence, I’ve drawn all pages I could draw
Ah, “one time” becomes
Every “one time” becomes
Soon, a large accumulation of a strength inside of you
All around, I look at them
Comparing what I do with them
What is it only I can do that nobody else can?
Even if I’ve got no true confidence, I’m moving on
Covered in thoughts and emotion within
Unknown to me, a brand new feeling
And, on the day I took the step for the first time
Including even this, new pain that I felt too
Liking what I believe in and facing it led
To a touch of the preview of a light
Gonna be alright, let us go
All I can do now is to have the fun
Everything is on the line as I draw
Using my own unique usage of colors and
Every dawn, every night, I would keep on running
And now I found the blue glowing light on me
Liking what you believe in and facing it too
Can be still terrifying but now I know
No longer am I these versions of me living in transparency
Now I know how to be my precious incomparable new self
See what, see what, covered deep inside
Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on
Pretending won’t bring it out of sight
It is always waiting there, still always waiting there for you and
See what, see what, covered deep inside
Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on
Pretending won’t bring it out of sight
It is always waiting there, waiting inside of you
啊 一如既往
重复的日子里 我总是打着哈欠
欢庆过后 夜幕逐渐隐去
涩谷沐浴着晨光的照耀
不知为何 近来我总是
倍感无尽的空虚
我总是无法圆满
但本就如此
这本就是生活的部分
就这样吧
探寻看清是何深藏内心
向我们敞开那 在你心扉共鸣的声响 坚持住
就算再想视若无睹
但仍是会在你面前
呼唤声传来 我想按自己所想
选择色彩涂绘 随后
刹那间 惺忪晨风吹拂而来
湛蓝的世界豁然出现在我面前
虔心坚守信仰 立下誓言
虽然会惊恐万分 但我知道
我终将探寻出 我所拥有的真相
啊 我越是想伸手 去企及梦想
但却越来越遥远
浑浑噩噩又度一日
我总是行色匆匆 挣扎着
苦涩都源自于我所想
屈辱情结令我落泪
越是前行 路途越是艰难
疼痛都在不断更迭
呼唤声传来 前行的步伐
都顺着我的抉择沿途进发
那夜我撑着疲惫的睡眼
紧握住眼前蔚蓝的誓言
坚守信念并既往前赴
全程中踏出的每个脚印并非只有欢乐
不知自己是否力所能及 我开始有些许担忧
啊 又绘出一条线
绘出每条线的同时
我都缺乏自信 但我仍尽力绘满所有篇章
啊 首次出现
就会有更多的每次
不久后你内心便积蓄强大能量
环顾四周 我看着周围的人
将自己同他们作比较
有什么事是只有我才能完成
即便我并不是真正的自信 但我仍将继续
被无数莫名难表明的
想法和情绪包围 全新的感受
就在首次迈出步伐的那日
我甚至还能感受到全新的疼痛
但我将坚守信念 迎面去
触及那一缕微弱灯光
但一切都将无恙 出发前行吧
我现在只想享受当下的美好
一切都尽在我的描绘中
使用我独具的调色法则
不论黎明还是黑夜 我都将不懈奔跑
如今眼前蔚蓝绚烂的光芒出现在眼前
坚守内心信念 勇敢迎面
虽然仍会惊恐万分 但我知道
我不再如曾经的生活 活得那般透明
现在我将塑造全新珍贵 无与伦比的自己
探寻看清是何深藏内心
向我们敞开那 在你心扉共鸣的声响 坚持住
就算再想视若无睹
但仍是会在你面前 依旧出现在你眼前
探寻看清是何深藏内心
向我们敞开那 在你心扉共鸣的声响 坚持住
就算再想视若无睹
但仍是会在你面前 留存在你心底
