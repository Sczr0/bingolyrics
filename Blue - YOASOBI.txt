Ah, like every day I see
啊 一如既往
Another day repeats, I’m yawning all the time
重复的日子里 我总是打着哈欠
After all the cheers, the night, it fades out and
欢庆过后 夜幕逐渐隐去
Shibuya receives a pour of the morning light
涩谷沐浴着晨光的照耀
And somehow, an emptiness surrounds
不知为何 近来我总是
That’s what I always feel
倍感无尽的空虚
Something is not enough
我总是无法圆满
That’s how it’s gonna be
但本就如此
It’s all a part of life
这本就是生活的部分
I’ll let this be
就这样吧
See what, see what, covered deep inside
探寻看清是何深藏内心
Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on
向我们敞开那 在你心扉共鸣的声响 坚持住
Pretending won’t bring it out of sight
就算再想视若无睹
It is always waiting there for you
但仍是会在你面前
Calling followed, what I feel’s to be drawn
呼唤声传来 我想按自己所想
Going by my selection in this color, then

Suddenly, with the breeze of a drowsy morning

I’ve finally come across a true discovery of what I got

Ah, the more that I reach out my hands to what I need

The further it becomes

Another one of these unruly days go on
浑浑噩噩又度一日
I’m always in a hurry as I’m struggling
我总是行色匆匆 挣扎着
Misery, stemming from all my thoughts

Humiliation brings new tears into my view

The more that I step in, the harder it becomes
越是前行 路途越是艰难
Even the pain renews

Calling followed, what I feel is the move
呼唤声传来 前行的步伐
Going by my selection in this path I walk
都顺着我的抉择沿途进发
On a night fighting off eyelids dropping heavy
那夜我撑着疲惫的睡眼
I’m grabbing tight, the blue vow in front of me
紧握住眼前蔚蓝的誓言
Taking what you believe and to keep doing so
坚守信念并既往前赴
Every step’s not only fun all the time
全程中踏出的每个脚印并非只有欢乐
Don’t know if I’m able, cause I am worried a little
不知自己是否力所能及 我开始有些许担忧
Ah, “one line” was drawn

Missing inner confidence, I’ve drawn all pages I could draw
我都缺乏自信 但我仍尽力绘满所有篇章
Ah, “one time” becomes
啊 首次出现
Every “one time” becomes

Soon, a large accumulation of a strength inside of you

All around, I look at them

What is it only I can do that nobody else can?
有什么事是只有我才能完成
Even if I’ve got no true confidence, I’m moving on
即便我并不是真正的自信 但我仍将继续
Covered in thoughts and emotion within
被无数莫名难表明的
Unknown to me, a brand new feeling
想法和情绪包围 全新的感受
And, on the day I took the step for the first time
就在首次迈出步伐的那日
Including even this, new pain that I felt too

Liking what I believe in and facing it led
但我将坚守信念 迎面去
To a touch of the preview of a light

Gonna be alright, let us go

All I can do now is to have the fun

Everything is on the line as I draw

Using my own unique usage of colors and
