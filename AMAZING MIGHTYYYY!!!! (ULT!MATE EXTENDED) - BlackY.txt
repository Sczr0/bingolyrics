Are you ready
GO!
When I around, don't be lazy
I rock'n the house till the shit goes crazy
You better not say "maybe"
When I ask you to be my baby
Come around let's hang out
Having a good time with the stereo loud
Come around let's hang out
Start the tape and break it down!
You got me thinking of you
in every step I take
I'm running out of control
with every move I make
So go ahead, electrify my body
The night lights, they got me feeling naughty
You asked me for a chance
to start a new romance
Just go away you fool!
You got a first chance,
you got a second chance,
you want a third chance,
now I stop it.
You love me like you do it baby,
Got me feeling bad when you come to me,
this is killing me
You love me like you do it and hold me close to you
Giving love to me,this is killing me
You love me like you do it baby,
Got me feeling bad when you come to me,
this is killing me
You love me like you do it and hold me close to you
Giving love to me, this is killing me.

When I around, don't be lazy
