To see how that moon is shining beauty
While I’m all by myself, surrounded by trees
On the edge of departure, to be starting my journey
Up to that day, reliving's came across my view
Few riches that we had
However, all this kindness stood by me
My mother’s own
That sketching I was drawing and painted on
I love it, she voiced, it was caring that was shown
So we could make a living
She gave her dream away, went to work instead
And even so, to come the day we parted
Then we came to meet and in such a time
Falling for you, I learned of real love
See, I was feeling that joy was bound to be
So, state, why’s it that all I’m treasuring has been fading to end in a cruel
Ah, realm of gathering woes?
I convey byes to all
I need to go and meet up with you straight away
Proceeding up to where you now remain
Heart is with you, forgive me
All at once, I heard your voice
And it caught me off guard
So, acting to end everything in that style
Wish to be departed and gone
Can’t anymore encounter people, as you know
On nights full moon is seen
And I could not reach for that side
I fell, to end up on the ground, it’s been surprising
The moon chatted with me
At that very time, gave me a mystifying talent
Powers crept out
I pour life into things I see and draw
As I distribute with this power
Even all the dying greenery
Restoring all the essence, too
And I could give it this time that I hold, and I’m left to live
I spread it to all the life I was then drawing
Small pieces, I divided it into
Then I found a meaning to my life
So was everything when I got to meet you
Resembling me
You have been, over the days, living in the woes
And when I tried to leave before and end it on my own
Got mad at me for it all
In the bat of an eye, I was mesmerized
But I know you already have somebody who’s so dear to you
He went on and betrayed you, and you know it’s wrong
And even so, to reside inside you, love for him to flow
So, now, he’s on the way to a fade-out
Life to lose all hues
You kept on crying, and it was his name you called
It took that sight of you to make me realize
Amid a single day
So, committed all the soul to drawing to pour in my life
In what I sketched out
And from there, he was restored, opening eyes
I made it happen, it’s a miracle painted
As you were shedding tears coming from you blissfully
Sparing no trial
Want to have you knowing my thought
Finally, listen
In that way, giving me the joy to live my life again
I will tell you, I so truly had love for you deep inside
See you, goodbye
In the end, it’s just me
As I’m picturing you, my mom is in my thoughts
Was thinking of you, and slowly closing my eyes
End of the line of such a long journey
Finally united again
我独自伫立在林中
仰望着皎洁的月色
在这段旅途开始之前
至今为止的回忆  浮现眼前
虽然我们没有什么钱
但母亲的温柔
一直陪伴着我
对我所画的简笔画说着
“我很喜欢”  言语间流露关爱
所以我们能生活下去
她放弃了梦想 选择了打工
即便如此 分开的一天依然到来
在那时我遇见了你
为你倾倒  也知晓了何为真爱
我曾觉得 快乐是生活的必然
可为何 我所珍重之物却在残酷地消失
噢，难道我才是苦难的根源吗
于是我决定向全世界告别
我要启程  然后心无旁骛地前来见你
一直到你现在所在的地方为止
“我的心一直属于你，真是对不起啊”
那一刻 我听到了你的声音
这让我措手不及
所以，我以这种方式结束一切
愿能与这个世界  彻底分开
如你所知  我再不会遇到任何人
静谧的夜晚  满月高悬
可我却未能如愿赴黄泉
我带着惊讶  落在那片林地
月光在我耳边轻语
在那时  给予了我不可思议的力量
这力量  要以岁月为代价
我依靠这种力量
将我的生命注入我所见所画
连那已然枯萎的草儿
也能焕发新生
我能将持有的时间赠予它们  只需消耗我的生命
我将生命不断地散布着  不断地画着
一点一滴地  将其分开
于是我找到了生命的意义
我曾将这当作我余生的全部  直到我遇见了【你】
像我一样
【你】也整日活在悲伤中
在我将要了结我的人生时
【你】会为此生气
眨眼之间， 我就沦陷于【你】
但我知道 【你】已经心有所属
他曾抛弃【你】、背叛【你】，你也知道这样不对
即使如此，【你】心中对他的爱意依然流淌
如今 他的生命正在凋零
即将消失殆尽
【你】哭喊着他的名字
看到【你】这般模样 我做出了觉悟
给自己留下最后一天
在那一天之外  为我最后的画作
献上了我的全部灵魂  耗尽我的余生
于是他终于睁眼  缓缓醒来
对我所唤起的  画出的奇迹
【你】喜极而泣
无论如何
都想让【你】知道我的心意
用【你】的方式  给我欢喜 让我宛若重生
我要告诉【你】  我如此真切而深沉地爱着【你】
再见了。
落幕之时  我孑然一身
和【你】、和母亲曾度过的种种在脑海中浮现
我想起了你，然后缓缓闭上双眼
这样遥远的旅途  总算是走到了终点
终于  又再度相见
