To see how that moon is shining beauty
While I’m all by myself, surrounded by trees
On the edge of departure, to be starting my journey
Up to that day, reliving's came across my view
Few riches that we had
However, all this kindness stood by me
My mother’s own
That sketching I was drawing and painted on
I love it, she voiced, it was caring that was shown
So we could make a living
She gave her dream away, went to work instead
And even so, to come the day we parted
Then we came to meet and in such a time
Falling for you, I learned of real love
See, I was feeling that joy was bound to be
So, state, why’s it that all I’m treasuring has been fading to end in a cruel
Ah, realm of gathering woes?
I convey byes to all
I need to go and meet up with you straight away
Proceeding up to where you now remain
Heart is with you, forgive me
All at once, I heard your voice
And it caught me off guard
So, acting to end everything in that style
Wish to be departed and gone
Can’t anymore encounter people, as you know
On nights full moon is seen
And I could not reach for that side
I fell, to end up on the ground, it’s been surprising
The moon chatted with me
At that very time, gave me a mystifying talent
Powers crept out
I pour life into things I see and draw
As I distribute with this power
Even all the dying greenery
Restoring all the essence, too
And I could give it this time that I hold, and I’m left to live
I spread it to all the life I was then drawing
Small pieces, I divided it into
Then I found a meaning to my life
So was everything when I got to meet you
Resembling me
You have been, over the days, living in the woes
And when I tried to leave before and end it on my own
Got mad at me for it all
In the bat of an eye, I was mesmerized
But I know you already have somebody who’s so dear to you
He went on and betrayed you, and you know it’s wrong
And even so, to reside inside you, love for him to flow
So, now, he’s on the way to a fade-out
Life to lose all hues
You kept on crying, and it was his name you called
It took that sight of you to make me realize
Amid a single day
So, committed all the soul to drawing to pour in my life
In what I sketched out
And from there, he was restored, opening eyes
I made it happen, it’s a miracle painted
As you were shedding tears coming from you blissfully
Sparing no trial
Want to have you knowing my thought
Finally, listen
In that way, giving me the joy to live my life again
I will tell you, I so truly had love for you deep inside
See you, goodbye
In the end, it’s just me
As I’m picturing you, my mom is in my thoughts
Was thinking of you, and slowly closing my eyes
End of the line of such a long journey
Finally united again
我独自伫立在林中
仰望着皎洁的月色
在这段旅途开始之前
至今为止的回忆  浮现眼前
虽然我们没有什么钱
但母亲的温柔
一直陪伴着我
对我所画的简笔画说着
“我很喜欢”  言语间流露关爱
所以我们能生活下去
她放弃了梦想 选择了打工
即便如此 分开的一天依然到来
在那时我遇见了你
为你倾倒  也知晓了何为真爱
我曾觉得 快乐是生活的必然
可为何 我所珍重之物却在残酷地消失
噢，难道我才是苦难的根源吗
于是我决定向全世界告别
我要启程  然后心无旁骛地前来见你
一直到你现在所在的地方为止
“我的心一直属于你，真是对不起
