The  city  starts  to  fade  into  the  setting  sun
as  I  turn  my  back  and  walk  the  lonely  road
I  felt  your  hand  slip  through  my  fingers  once  again
and  what  was  left  was  just  a  momentary  warmth
Every  time  I  felt  your  touch,it  would  seep  into  my  heart
if  I  could  hold  you  for  a  little  longer
and  the  lingering  scent  as  you  whispered  in  my  ear
would  fade  forever  in  the  vivid  sky
I  hear  the  sound  of  your  voice,I  hear  it  echo  inside  my  dreams
turning  into  memories  as  they  start  to  fall  away
and  the  tears  that  I  cry,washed  away  by  the  rain
I  promise  this  is  where  I'll  be,
waiting  for  you
Without  a  sound  the  days  are  slowly  passing  by
and  the  night  is  like  a  story  without  an  end
The  only  light  that  shines  upon  the  quiet  world
are  the  stars  and  they  will  lead  me  back  to  you
As  I  find  another  piece  of  a  memory  inside
as  the  story  grows  a  little  longer
and  the  look  on  your  face  as  you  waved  your  hand  goodbye
would  fade  forever  in  the  darkened  sky
I  drown  inside  these  memories,I  feel  them  fall  from  the  sky  above
washing  everything  away  and  staining  me  in  gray
but  I  will  stand  in  the  rain,until  I  know  that  I've  found  you
this  is  where  I'll  always  be,
waiting  for  you
I  hear  the  sound  of  your  voice,I  hear  it  echo  inside  my  dreams
turning  into  memories  as  they  start  to  fall  away
and  the  tears  that  I  cry,washed  away  by  the  rain
I  promise  this  is  where  I'll  be,
waiting  for  you
waiting  for  you
waiting  for  you
城市开始渐渐消失在夕阳下
当我转身走上孤独的路
我觉得你的手从我的手指再次溜走
剩下的只是一个短暂的温暖
每当我感觉到你的触摸，它就会渗透到我的心
如果我可以抱着你一会儿
还有挥之不去的气味，你在我的耳边低语
生动的天空会永远消失
我听到你的声音，我听到它回声在我的梦里
当他们开始坠落的记忆
和我哭的眼泪,被雨水冲走
我保证这是我将要去的地方
等待着你
没有声音的日子正在慢慢地流逝
夜晚就像一个没有尽头的故事
在宁静的世界上闪耀的光
是星星，他们将带领我回到你身边
当我找到另一片记忆里面
随着故事的发展变得越来越长
当你挥手告别时，脸上的表情
会在黑暗的天空永远消失
我淹没在这些记忆,感觉他们从天空坠落
把所有的东西都冲洗掉，把我染灰
但我会站在雨里，直到我知道我找到了你
这是我永远
等待着你
我听到你的声音，我听到它回声在我的梦里
当他们开始坠落的记忆
和我哭的眼泪,被雨水冲走
我保证这是我将要去的地方
等待着你
等待着你
等待着你
