I've walked for as long as I have known,
Discarded the things I needed most.
I thought that, alone, I could be strong,
Keep going on.
But days come where everything's undone,
Unraveling loose, unkempt, unstrung,
And I can't keep on holding on.
Filled with something I cannot describe,
In the darkened night, I still know the way.
Even then are days where I might lose the sight of it.
Cause it's easy to feel as though I'm alone
When I seem so lost, without a home.
But given time, it's all just in the past.
This emptiness can make it seem like we're still strangers
On a winding road or passing through the starless sky,
But this distance doesn't have to own my life.
At times, all my memories seem to blur
As though a deep fog has come for good.
I thought that, alone, I'd clear it all
And see again.
Your words and your feelings carry through
And easily doubt gives way to truth.
Like waking up at last, I'm freed.
Filled with something I cannot describe,
You have given me so much every time.
I can feel the strength within is growing day by day.
For once in my life, I feel like I'm home,
No longer am I just on my own.
I've left the rest behind within the past.
And even if on certain days, we seem like strangers
Moving suddenly in different ways, it still won't break apart
What we have or who we are inside.
Tell me what lies beyond the future.
Promise me we'll try together to
Hold on when going through our darkest struggles.
Promise that I will stay here with you.
You have my own heart forevermore.
Even if this remains unspoken.
For once in my life, no longer alone,
I feel like I'm finally at home
And opened up a brand new world inside.
And ever should our promises fall into pieces,
Moving suddenly in different ways, it still won't break apart
What we have or who we are inside.
You'll have me forevermore.
我已奔波了如此之久
抛却了最需要的事物
我想，孤独，使我更加坚强
然后继续前进
但如果那天到来 我仍然事事未竟
我的身心会松垮、凌乱
并且无法再坚持下去
有无法形容的事物充斥其中
但身处黑夜，我仍能知晓方向
尽管那天到来时 我或许已看不见前路
当我迷茫至极 无家可归之时
便容易产生 孤身一人的感觉
但最终，一切都将是过往云烟
这种空虚感的到来 仿佛你我只是萍水相逢
即便前路蜿蜒曲折 即便夜空没有群星
这段经历在我人生中 不过是沧海一粟
有时，我所有的记忆似乎非常模糊
仿佛浓雾要永远笼罩于此处
我想，孤独，使我消除迷蒙
继续看向前方
你将所言所感 贯彻到底
容易让人迟疑 是否为真相让步
就像我最终苏醒，得到解脱
有无法形容的事物充斥其中
但你已经为我付出如此之多
我能感受到 内在的力量日益强大
人生中第一次，我有种归家的感觉
而我也将不再形单影只
我已把多余之物 留在了过去
即使有朝一日，我们形同陌路
踏上不同的旅途，也决不会瓦解
我们所拥有的 以及我们的内在
请告诉我 未来之路藏着什么
请答应我 与我同舟共济
哪怕我们正经历着最黑暗的斗争
我保证 我会和你在一起
我的心永远属于你
即便这无法用言语表达
人生中第一次，我不再是孤身一人
仿佛自己终已归家
并且内心开辟出一片崭新的世界
哪怕我们间的承诺四分五裂
踏上不同的旅途，也决不会瓦解
我们所拥有的 以及我们的内在
我永远属于你
