Mend your pace sway to the beat
Hands up Embrace who you wanna be
We're reaching heights unseen
Feel the fire deep within
You're the key to where my trust begins

Off the ground and tap your feet
Look stars are near when you feel the beat
We're bound for a greater height
Take a leap into the blazing
