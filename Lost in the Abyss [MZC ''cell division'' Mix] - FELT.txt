Loved you once and again.
I'd become just your plaything.
Nothing had mattered that night
And I realize I had been pulled by your whims.
(I'm breaking down,)
(I am faced with the end of the world.)
I just can't understand.
Deep inside, there is wanting.
Sounds that I've all but shut out
Echoes hollow, unbound. Now I am trapped in a mist.
This heaviness is drowning me.
I'm slow, can't control the actions I am fighting.
I'm grasping at distorted glass.
I wonder if I can be seen.
I can't stop myself from looking behind from the end,
Reaching around so blindingly till I start to bend.
And I'm standing, surrounded, so close to the edge.
Tumbling down forever, will I ever find any solace?
（I can't stop myself from looking behind from the end）（
（Tumbling down forever, will I ever find any solace?）（
（I can't stop myself from looking behind from the end）（
This sight I see is confusing me.
I've fallen behind in this revolving city.
Reality is like a dream.
I wonder if I can exist.
I can't stop myself from looking behind from the end,
Reaching around so blindingly till I start to bend.
And I'm standing, surrounded, so close to the edge.
Tumbling down forever, will I ever find any solace?
我一次又一次的爱上你
甚至已经成为你的玩物
一个风平浪静的夜晚
我意识到我只是被你的幻想驱使
(我已经快要崩溃)
(我曾面对着世界的终焉)
只是无法理解
内心深处，为何仍怀抱希望
我曾经的呼唤都被我弃之门外
空洞的回音，脱离控制，我陷入这薄雾中
这份负担淹没了我
我缓慢的，无法控制的战斗着
紧握这扭曲的镜子
我能否被看到呢？
我无法抑制地在这终点回首
不断向前，直到我开始扭曲
矗立着，环顾四周，距离边缘近在咫尺
不断坠落，我是否得到过安慰？
我无法抑制地在这终点回首）
不断坠落，我是否得到过安慰？）
我无法抑制地在这终点回首）
我看到的景象却令我迷惑
我被这旋转的城市遗落
现实如同梦境
不知道我是否能继续存在
我无法抑制地在这终点回首
不断向前，直到我开始扭曲
矗立着，环顾四周，距离边缘近在咫尺
不断坠落，我是否得到过安慰？
