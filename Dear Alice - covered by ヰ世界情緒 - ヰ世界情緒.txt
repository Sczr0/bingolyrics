[By:以无形之歌]
I'm losing my faith in you
我不再信任你了
My long lost friend
我心爱的，我最后的朋友
Alice
爱丽丝啊
Roses have lost their colors and it's breaking my heart
玫瑰失去了他们的颜色，这伤透了我的心
Ah....
啊……
You take my breath away
你夺取了我的呼吸
And I don't know what to do
我不知道该如何是好
Before you say last word that makes me want to lay you down
在你说出那句促使我想让你长眠的，最后的话语之前
I'll __s_ I'll _o_h I'll __t you into the pieces
我会亲吻你，触碰你，将你砍成碎片
And you'll feel the same
你会感同身受
And you'll know my crave
你会知晓我的渴望
And you'll see that I'm the only one for you
你会明白我是你的唯一
But you don't understand
但你不明白
But you don't feel the same
但你不再有同样的感觉了
And I throw you down into where you've come from
所以我将你抛回了你到来的地方
You're falling through the cracks of time
你在时间的裂隙里坠落
Only to remain the same
只为了一如既往
You're falling down the path you made
你在你自作的道路上坠落
You're trapped in twilight
你会被困在暮色之中
You'll never ever feel the pain
你再也不会感受到痛苦
You'll never ever hear the morning rain
你再也听不见清晨的雨声
Keep falling,keep falling,keep falling down
永远地坠落吧
