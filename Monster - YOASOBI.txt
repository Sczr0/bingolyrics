Ah, so what a scene, let's do another toast to confine
Match a city, overflowing laughing voices are
Pretended fabrications of a lie, blinded eye, deception
I'm trying not to go mad
Could a, could an aroma come and feed the brain in tune
With stimulation, reawaken inclinations
Don't know who's gonna go there today, I wonder
If I kept trying then, what can I, that cannot be done
On to the world, what can I, that cannot be done
Looking in those dark little eyes, I decide
I need to not once let your tear fall beneath
Ah, get out to find it now, don't ever let go
The brighter future knows to reach it
Even when the world is caught and full of wrong
Keep needing ya to laugh and be free for once
No, I cannot be hurting no one
I wanted, I wanted to be stronger now
Woken to resume my need to stay the real me
So what a scene, here's to another safely passed time
Masking every new bad rumor flowing in the city
Feel the lie, feel the lie, release to turn a blind eye
Choking on their own hysteria
Marching with an innocence, they proceed
To a location echoing the sound of feet skipping and
Feeling high, feeling high, memories of a lasting flavor
The other side's insanity
Ahh
Can you call the "standard good" a living at all
And can "nobody feeling sadder" be a living at all
How is a straighter path you could see a living at all
So let's imagine going "no mistake" as living at all
And I don't wanna live as you'd assume, be saying it's right
And artificially be living and you're saying it's right
I don't know what I'll be, and to believe this, I wonder
Want to know the truth, what I'm inside and under
Oh, spill me the tale
Oh, spill me the tale
Still, we reside inside а dry confusing big world
I make a wish alone
Believe it, I just wanna be with you forever
Give me hope to be just smiling with you again
Ah, the skipping beating in my heart
Is shaking me within, and begins to shout
"Now you got to move, go make the way"
I will rise to prove the fragile little "myself"
Go bite into my own and reach it
Even when the world is caught, and full of wrong
Keep needing ya to laugh and be free for once
No, I cannot see nobody cry
I wanted, I wanted to be stronger now
Woken to resume my need to stay the real me
I'm gonna keep ya from danger, there are too many
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running for you
I will overcome what is residing for you
好一番景致 让我们举杯欢庆
充斥满城的欢笑声
皆是捏造的谎言 双眼被欺瞒
我仍试图保持理智
漫进的芳香 是否会伴随着刺激
重唤大脑的意识
今日谁将前赴 我思索着
迈向世界路途中 若我仍是固执
力所能及之事 也迟早会破灭
面前漆黑眼眸 我下定决心
绝不会让你流下一滴泪水
现在就起身去寻找 不放弃任何机会
明晰的未来 已触手可及
即便整个世界 已尽是荒谬
可我希望你能保持微笑 自由无阻
我不会伤害任何人
如今 我只想变得更强大
复苏后竭尽所能 以维系真我
好一番景致 庆幸我们又能安然度日
以此掩盖城里新流传的噩耗
纵使谎言逼近 却仍视若无睹
我已歇斯底里 几近窒息
他们装作无知地前行着
去往那处回荡着脚步声
萦绕着记忆中 难以挥散的气息 情绪攀升
抵达失智的另一极致
所谓优质的标准 能赖以去生存吗
仅是无人悲伤 就能安心度日吗
踏上平坦前路去生活又如何
何不随所想 不留差错地去生活
我不愿按照 你自以为完美的设想
去虚伪地生活
我不知自己将会是何种模样 也不知有何信仰
想探清真相 将自我看透彻
都告诉我吧
都告诉我吧
尽管我们身处于混杂的大千世界中
但我仍独自许愿
恪守心头 期盼能永远守候你身旁
赋予我希望 为和你再度 绽放笑颜
悸动的心跳
在我体内震动 向我呐喊道
"是时候行动 开拓前路了"
我将崛起 以此证明所谓 脆弱渺小的”我“
咬紧牙关 向目标进发
即便整个世界 已尽是荒谬
可我希望你能保持微笑 自由无阻
因为我不愿 看到有人流泪
如今 我只想变得更强大
复苏后竭尽所能 以维系真我
危机四伏 我只想护你周全
为你而不懈奔赴
我将克服 阻挠你的一切
