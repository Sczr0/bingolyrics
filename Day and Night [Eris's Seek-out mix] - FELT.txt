Never knowing where our own futures lie,
And easily we start simplifying all our planning,
Leaving it to circumstances.
Why should we be worried 'bout rushing forth
When we can take it slow and enjoy all that life has to offer us tonight?
Surely there's more than that.
Never knowing where our own futures lie,
And easily we start taking everything for granted,
Disregarding consequences.
Why should we be worried 'bout holding back?
If we can stop ourselves from the habit of putting too much into our minds,
Everything changes then.
What does it take for us to realize
It's not simple living with one's own regrets.
This is a path that cannot be erased... We've run out of time.
One of these lone days, waking up when things
have changed, I can't run from it.
Suddenly, the time keeps on moving on
Without your sweet laughter.
Miss you day and night.
I know that I miss you day and night,
When you had been mine.
Thinking we could let time just slip away,
And idly keep going around in circles endlessly,
Leading into isolation.
Keeping everything hidden by a sleeve...
Yet if we open up, could there be one more chance to relive that very time?
Knowing that changes things.
One of these lone days, waking up when things
have changed, I can't run from it.
Suddenly, the time keeps on moving on
Without your sweet laughter.
Miss you day and night.
I know that I miss you day and night,
When you had been mine.
I've loved you all this time.
I've loved you all this time.
I've loved you all this time....
前路漫漫，不知通往何方
你我总无意地不去考虑太多
任其随波逐流
明当可以纵享今夜美好
你我又为何要担忧前途多舛？
其中缘由，当不止如此
前路漫漫，不知通往何方
你我轻易将一切视作理所当然
却忽视了因果相报
如果你我能不再独自承担一切
试问又为何要担忧路途险阻
然此时，已是沧海桑田
是什么让你我明晰
背负悔恨独自走下去是如此艰难
留下的脚印无法磨灭 你我终面临决别
某一日，于孤独中我睁开双眼
面对世事变迁，却无处可逃
恍惚间，冻结的时间亦重新流动
然你的笑容却仍冰封其中
日以继夜，牵恋你于心
我明白，我仍日夜牵恋你于心
直至你我相依
自认能放纵时光流逝
因而怠惰地踱步不前
最终落得孤身一人
将一切掩于袖中
然若你我坦诚相待，是否又能重温那美好时光？
醒悟之时，一切豁然开朗
于孤独时光中，我睁开双眼
唯能面对沧海桑田
刹那间，凝固的时间开始融化
然你的笑容却仍冰封其中
日以继夜，牵恋你于心
我知晓，我仍日夜牵恋你于心
直至彼此相依
我心始终倾慕于你...
我心始终倾慕于你...
我心始终倾慕于你...
