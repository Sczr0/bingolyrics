Finding in myself something dormant
It slumbers in peace and sighs.
Slowly, it begins to start stirring,
Awakening from inside.
Looking ever forward to what may lie ahead
It’s hard to find a reason not to satisfy my need to find
Adventure every way in which things may come to pass.
Searching on far and wide, until I touch the sky.
It may be said there’s no reason to try
And such dreams are just meant for the passing of time.
But if we just find ourselves and believe
Does it even matter what the other one thinks?
When we’re surrounded by the darkness,
The weight upon our shoulders,
It closes in abruptly.
It’s hard to stand back up again.
But if we just remember
The light we keep inside us,
It won’t lead us astray. We’ll find the right way.
Have you ever wondered why things can get so bad?
When we have clearly lost our way, we hide within the things we know.
But even when uncertainty casts a darkened view
Just reach inside yourself and find the real you.
But if we just find ourselves and believe
Does it even matter what the other one thinks?
To find the strength to see so clearly,
Determination standing,
My faith remains the same so
I’ll always find the path again.
With each new day we’re facing,
Each time, a new beginning.
Running on, never looking back. I’ll reach out.
I have set myself on an unknown road.
There’s no turning back. I’ll go with the flow.
Finding the strength to believe…
When we’re surrounded by the darkness,
The weight upon our shoulders,
It closes in abruptly.
It’s hard to stand back up again.
But if we just remember
The light we keep inside us,
It won’t lead us astray. We’ll find the right way.
To find the strength to see so clearly,
Determination standing,
My faith remains the same so
I’ll always find the path again.
With each new day we’re facing,
Each time, a new beginning.
Running on, never looking back. I’ll reach out.
Finding in myself something dormant
It slumbers in peace and sighs.
Slowly, it begins to start stirring,
Awakening from inside.
发觉有某物一直在我心中
随叹息沉眠,不曾被打扰
渐渐地,它自沉眠中睁开双眼
于心底掀起阵阵涟漪
不曾言弃地追寻前方的未知天地
没有理由令我按捺胸中的求知欲
探索着概率之树的每一条分叉
遍历世间万象,直至以指间触碰天际
追觅所谓的梦也不过是浪费光阴
但若能揣怀定念,坚持真我
又何须顾忌他人的蜚语?
当我们身陷无边黑暗
那落在肩上的重担
毫无预兆地袭来
令再度迈步都变得难移如山
但若你我能够谨记
那心中的光芒定会指引前路
循其所向,我们定能找到光明
你曾否思索过这窘境的源头为何?
当迷失方向时,人总会躲在自己的小天地中寻求慰藉
但纵使前途未卜,笼于重重阴影之中
只需回想起自己的初心,便能将其跨越
若能直面自我,不为外物所动
任他人冷眼相对又有何妨?
为找寻明辨是非的力量
以决心面对寒风冽雨
心中的信念不曾有渝
因而我定能一次次地寻得正途
随着黎明的每一次到来
都以曙光划下新的起点
放手追逐,不再回首.我终会找到出路.
如今我站在这未知道路的起点
身后已无路可退,唯能顺激流前行
寻觅支撑信念的力量...
当周遭一切被黑暗笼罩
千斤重担落于你我肩上
来的如此不由分说
令再度迈步都变得难移如山
但若你我能谨记
那藏于心底的光芒定不会引往歧途
循其所向,我们定能找到前路
为寻得分辨真伪的力量
以决心面对重重困境
心中的信念始终如一
而我定能再次找到自己的道路
随着日夜次次交替
都以曙光划下新的起点
放手追逐,不再回首.我终会找到出路.
发觉某物已居于心中许久
被叹息所拥,浅眠于宁静之中
渐渐地,它从沉睡中被唤醒
于心底掀起阵阵悸动
