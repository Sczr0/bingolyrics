Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
I Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
I Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
I Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
I Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her,
or anyone, or anything, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
I Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
I Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
从前从前那些错误铸成前
我走进了你的视线在我寂寞时你钻进我心底
你发现了我 你发现了我 你发现了我
我猜你蛮不在乎 我猜我就喜欢你这调调
当我跌得凄惨 你却见风转舵
离开我 离开我 离开我
他的心早已不在 当他人在我身边
而我意识到 只能怪我自己
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
如今我如此不堪
使我陷入我不曾身处的局面
直至你将我推下
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
如今我如此不堪
使我陷入我不曾身处的局面
如今我身躺在冰冷坚硬的地板
噢 噢 大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
噢 噢 大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
不曾道歉 他永远不会看见那些眼泪
佯装得他不知情 他就是那原因
你往下沉没 你往下沉没 你往下沉没
我听说你已向前看 走出街上的流言蜚语
一直以来我举足不过 是你的新战绩
如今我看清 如今我看清 如今我看清
他的心早已不在 当他人在我身边
而我意识到 只能怪我自己
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
如今我如此不堪
使我陷入我不曾身处的局面
直至你将我推下
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
如今我如此不堪
使我陷入我不曾身处的局面
如今我身躺在冰冷坚硬的地板
噢 噢 大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
噢 噢 大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
那最可悲的恐惧 匍匐爬入心中
你不曾爱过我 或者她
或任何人 任何事
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
如今我如此不堪
使我陷入不曾身处的局面
直至你将我推下
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
如今我如此不堪
使我陷入我不曾身处的局面
如今我身躺在冰冷坚硬的地板
噢 噢 大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
噢 噢 大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
