The tiebreaker is undeniably the essence of all tournaments.
毋庸置疑，决胜局是所有比赛的精髓。
It is the fruit of hard work,
它是努力练习的成果，
the culmination of a valiant effort to fight,
是英勇战斗的高潮，
and the manifestation of absolute determination.

the flood of adrenaline that replenishes life,
是补充生命的肾上腺素的狂飙，
and the myriad of emotions

that they could relish in the very moment
在每个人都属于游戏的那一刻，
