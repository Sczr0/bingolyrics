The tiebreaker is undeniably the essence of all tournaments.
It is the fruit of hard work,
the culmination of a valiant effort to fight,
and the manifestation of absolute determination.
It is the desperation that creates friendship,
the flood of adrenaline that replenishes life,
and the myriad of emotions
that make one feel ever so momentarily blissful,
that they could relish in the very moment
where everyone belongs in the game.
I really love the tiebreaker.

== V - essence ==
Today, we shall celebrate
the uncertainties which were overcome,
the conflicts which were quelled,
and the sorrows which were lifted,
and create the greatest star
that will burst into the brightest supernovae
and illuminate the universe
This, is the true essence.

Close your eyes.

毋庸置疑，决胜局是所有比赛的精髓。
它是努力练习的成果，
是英勇战斗的高潮，
是绝对坚毅的体现。
它是创造友谊的绝望，
是补充生命的肾上腺素的狂飙，
是无数的情感，
使人感到如此短暂的幸福，
在每个人都属于游戏的那一刻，
他们可以享受其中。
我真的很喜欢决胜局。

今天，我们应当庆祝
那些被克服的变数，
那些被平息的冲突，
那些被消散的忧伤，
并创造出最伟大的明星，
迸发出最耀眼的超新星，
照亮整个宇宙。
这，就是真正的精髓
== VI - 永恒 ==
闭上你的眼睛。
