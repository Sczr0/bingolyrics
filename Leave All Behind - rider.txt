I can feel the rain upon my skin
It covers everything
But it's too late now
I remember you
And me

I can feel the rain upon my skin
It covers everything
But it’s too late now
I remember
Everything
And how careless that's we could be

But it's too late now
I remember you
And me

I can feel the rain up on my skin
It covers everything
But it's too late now
I remember
Everything
And how careless that's we could be

But it's too late now
I remember you
And me

But it's too late now
I remember you
And me

我能感到雨水浸透我的皮肤
它覆盖万物
现已太迟
但我仍旧记得你
与我
.
我能感到雨水穿透我的肌肤
它覆盖万物
早已太迟
我记得
一切
我们是多么粗心
.
但为时已晚
我还记得你
与我
.
我能感到雨水渗透我的皮肤
它覆盖万物
不过已经失时
我铭记
万事万物
我们太过鲁莽
.
但现无时
我记住你
与我
.
不认为早已太迟了吗
我依旧记得你
与我
