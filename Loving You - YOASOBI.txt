Suddenly, I feel like I cannot confine this urge
I'm sending my friend an SOS
To get her to listen to me talk, telling my story
What I think...
Oh, you know...
About that guy
Something that you told and said so often before
Oh, so feeble is such a reaction
I know I'm bugging you, I don't really care any more
You've gotta listen 'till my satisfaction
And now, it's time to make a move
Here goes my fourth confession
One-sided love, I doubt it's gonna happen
It's hard to take
No, we can just be friends, though
To let a "hi" come out as I am walking
Then, on my way, I seemed to feel's enough back then
Emotions I held in
Your voice, repeatedly, is resounding deep in my head
If only I had never opened up and let you know my thoughts
And kept them within, down in place
Now that you know what I will say from head to toe
I'll never get your heart to pace
When I first let you know it, it was ten years ago
I was too innocent, I spoke with a pure heart
Tried over five years back, too light and too unclear
And so, tried over three years back, got the same outcome
If only I could try again, I would rewrite every step from the start
So, I am time-traveling back to that very day
To retrieve my lines and win back my first confession
And to make sure, make sure I cut out everything
So, it will be alright
So, will it be okay?
Countless times, rejected as I was disappointed
Inside, was sore, I've been so often through it
But each time I was swayed by the things that you have always loved
They have become what brings me joy and takes my heart above
I'll always recall
I could never replace them
Now, those are what I call treasures I adore
This might fail, no big deal
Oh, I will tell you once more
How I feel, deep inside, about you
忽然有些坐立不安
向朋友发出急救信号
能否听我说
我觉得...
你知道吧...
我...
「那种事情当然知道 都多少次了」
他那种反应 有些许单薄
我知道很烦你 但我不在乎
即便听到耳朵长茧 也一定要好好听
现在是时候做出行动了
即将向他第四次告白
希望渺茫的单相思
难以承受
做朋友就好咯
哪怕擦身而过时 只能说一句“嗨”
我想 这样便已足够
我本这样收着情绪
可你的声音 于我脑中挥之不去
若是我未曾向你表露过情感多好
就这样藏匿着情感
你应该已经明白了我的话术吧
你应该不会怦然心动
初次告白 在十年前
那时有些许天真无邪
然后是五年前 却过于草率
再次大概是三年前
若是能将这一切 重演多好
那么 穿越时空 通往那日
重新抹除 最初的告白
将一切都擦除而净
那样便好
那样便好吧
无论多次被甩 无论多次失望
反复经历过多少苦痛回忆
次次触碰到你所喜爱的事物
总有一天 会成为我所喜爱的东西
我总会想起
那一切无法代替
如今已为我的宝藏
即便失败也无妨
还会再说一次
我 打从心底里 关于你...
