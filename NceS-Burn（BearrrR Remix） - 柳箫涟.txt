Living in the clouded dream

Searching for the quiet that you need to breathe
只为寻找供你喘息的静谧
Gave up on your sanity to hide behind your shadow
你放弃了理智，藏在影子里
While you tried to take the sun down
当你尝试摘下太阳……
Hearts will never change to gold
永远不会发光的心啊
Out there thinking that you're in the world alone
让流浪的我回想着这个孤独的世界
No one ever told you that you'll have to fight for something
没人告诉你要为某件事而奋斗
Or you never learn to balance
你永远学不会站稳脚跟……
It's too cold
寒风刺骨
Standing in the middle of the downfall
身处无尽堕落的中央
Looking in the mirror cuz it's only you
看向镜中的你，可惜只是你啊……
That you have to lose
你不得不选择抛弃
Heading back with only one way
雪漠茫茫，回头是岸
Trying to stop from running,but you can't wait
试图停下脚步，但已经来不及了
Bury all the evidence
埋藏所有痕迹
You'll only learn
你只会一次次吸取教训
When you crash and burn
当你走向崩溃、燃烧之时……
#Drop#
When you crash and burn
当你走向崩溃、燃烧之时
Living in a crazy world
活在疯狂的世界中
Following the path that always twists and turns
沿着一条蜿蜒曲折的路
Gave up on your sanity to hide behind the devil
你放弃了所剩无几的理智，躲在魔鬼背后
'Cuz you think you'll live forever
因为你觉得能够使你永生
Saying that you're getting old
你说你在慢慢变老
Out there thinking that you're in the world alone
让流浪的我回想着这个寂寞的世界
No one ever told you that you have to live for something
没人告诉你要为某件事而活着
Or in the end, you will be nothing
最后一事无成……
It's too cold
寒风刺骨
Standing in the middle of the downfall
身处无尽堕落的中央
Looking in the mirror cuz it's only you
看向镜中的你，可惜还是你啊……
That you have to lose
你不得不选择抛弃
Heading back with only one way
雪漠茫茫，回头是岸
Trying to stop from running,but you can't wait
试图停下脚步，但已经来不及了
Bury all the evidence
埋藏所有痕迹
You'll only learn
你只会一次次吸取教训
When you crash and burn
当你走向崩溃、燃烧之时……
