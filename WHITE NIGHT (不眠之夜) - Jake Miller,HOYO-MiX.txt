I want you to show me
Your fantasy. (Your fantasy)
No past and No future.
That's what I need. (That's what I need)
The groove takes it over.
We'll wait and see.
Even I might blank out
You and me.
I thought that dream could light our way.
Oh, be my savior and take me away. (away, away)
(Take me away)
Tick, and, tock, once more. You're hosting
A magic show I cannot escape.
There's nothing else left for me to do.
Going to the other side. (Other side)
I don't wanna be alone tonight.
Oh, Lead me with your altered sign.
There's no one else left for me to lose.
Heading to the other side. （Other side）
Just be my savior and take me away. (away, away)
(Singing with me everyone.)
I don't wanna be alone tonight.
Oh, bring me to the other side.
There's no one else left for me to lose.
Going to the other side. （Other side）
I don't wanna be alone tonight.
I'll bring you to my best disguise
Cuz I don't need（don't need to know the truth）
Let me rave forever in your lies.
