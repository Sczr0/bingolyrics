[Intro]
(DEMONDICE...)
[Chorus]
What is a man to a king
And a king to a god?
What is a god to a devil putting up a facade?
I need an outlet now
I need to write this down
(Write it down, write it all down)
[Verse 1]
Hi!
It’s been a minute since we had a chat
But time is finite, innit? 'Finna make it fast
Yeah, "Success is a *****", why complain that your luck ain’t the best?
When you’re "Rich and you’re famous" and ****in’ depressed?
Stuck in a mess of pretend pretense, uppers in the trash
Got a couple "Ins-'n-outs" that don’t involve crashes
So, “Past me”
You asked me, “So, how have you been?”
Did you want fiction? Addiction? A public mental snappin’?
(Wow)
How did this happen?
You ready to rattle some bones?
Thinking I'd dip to follow a script
And never look back at the demons at home?
Painting shame inside the brain like, "*****, too bad you ain’t a keeper"
Changing difficulty mid-way through the game to be a sleeper-hit
[Chorus]
Just pretend it’s nothing
An endless
“Wanting, getting, wanting”
I never stop
“One thing, always one thing”
I’ll always keep
Wanting, wanting more
What is a man to a king
And a king to a god?
What is a god to a devil putting up a facade?
I need an outlet now
I need to write this down
(Write it down, write it all down)
[Verse 2]
Dear diary
I’m still a ****in’ basket case
I say "I’ll keep on truckin’" but the fact is cars don’t run in space
I’m feeling angsty, and thankless, and like I fell from grace
In zero gravity, having me thinking like I got no place
I’m fading, the crowd is waiting
But my internal rating is, well, kinda shady
It's lately, "I’m just an alien"
Sailing on my “Self-made-ien” BS that I shell out
Tell my fans they’ll do well
Shout from the mountain I dwell
But does this ring any bells?
That I don’t mention the hell?
And changed the topic from the hot tip that they probably won’t sell?
I paint a pretty little image, it looks well from a distance
Blacking out the spell that gave this "nobody" an existence
Called LUCK
[Chorus]
Just pretend it’s nothing
An endless
“Wanting, getting, wanting”
I never stop
“One thing, always one thing”
I’ll always keep
Wanting, wanting more
What is a man to a king
And a king to a god?
What is a god to a devil putting up a facade?
I need an outlet now
I need to write this down
(Write it down, write it all down)
Just pretend it’s nothing
An endless
“Wanting, getting, wanting”
I never stop
“One thing, always one thing”
I’ll always keep
Wanting, wanting more
[Outro]
What does a demon believe in?
A king or a god?
I tell ‘em Dice won’t be leaving, so what are the odds
I get my outlet now?
I gotta write this down
(Write it down, write it all down)
对国王来说一个人算什么
而对神来说一个王算什么？
对一个披着画皮的恶魔来说神明又算什么？
现在我需要一个发泄口
我需要将这些都倾泻于笔尖
（写下来，全都写出来）
嘿！
自从我们聊过以后已经过去了一分钟
但时间是有限的，不是么？得快点来唱了
Yeah，“成功”真是该死，为何抱怨你的运气不是最好？
在你“名利双收”且该死地抑郁的时候？
陷入一堆虚假的借口，上位者皆是废物
得到几件没有支离破碎的“来龙去脉”
所以，“过去的我”
你曾问我，“所以，你近来如何？”
你是不是想要听听虚构情节？上瘾？一段公开的精神攻击？
(Wow)
所以这些曾如何发生？
你准备好活络筋骨了吗？
想着我最好沉下心去跟从剧本
然后永远不去回望那些家里的恶魔们？
在脑内描绘羞耻就像，“婊子，真可惜你不是一个看护”
在游戏中途困难地转变以成为一部黑马作品
只是装作无事发生
无穷无尽的
“渴求、掠
