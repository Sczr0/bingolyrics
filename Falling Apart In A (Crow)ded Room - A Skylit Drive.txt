Shut down and reignite
I spit out what I breathe
Through the dust and decay
I can't touch what I see
A reflection of me
Disengage the machine
Let the light fade away
Through the ash in the streets
As we fall into the grey
Into the fray
Take me away
Into the grey
I shouldn't stay but I can't let you go
We're face to face yet stand alone
I'm just a slave of a life split in two
Falling apart in a crowded room
You can choke on your greed
You can swallow the plague
I won't buy what is free
You're the one that will pay
In the land of the free
And the home of the fake
We're consumed by disease
As we fall into our graves
Fall into our graves
Fall into our graves
I shouldn't stay
I shouldn't stay  but I can't let you go
We're face to face yet stand alone
I'm just a slave of a life split in two
Falling apart in a crowded room
I shouldn't stay but I can't let you go
We're face to face yet stand alone
I'm just a slave of a life split in two
Falling apart in a crowded room
I can't let you go
Shut down and reignite
We are the dust that whispers
Ash from a fire inside
Death on the wind We whisper
Shut down and reignite
We are the dust that whispers
Ash from a fire inside
Death on the wind We whisper
I can't let you go
We're face to face yet stand alone
I'm just a slave of a life split in two
Falling apart in a crowded room
I shouldn't stay but I can't let you go
We're face to face yet stand alone
I'm just a slave of a life split in two
Falling apart in a crowded room
I shouldn't stay
but I can't let you go
I can't let you go
关再添薪燃火
我沉重地叹了口气
穿透过这尘埃腐朽
我无法触及眼前的那个
镜中的我
松开这机械开关
让灯光消退逝去
透过街道的灰烬可见
我们献身化作一片灰白
陷入斗争
解脱我吧
焚成灰色
我不该多留但无法抛弃纵容你走
明明照面相对却只是我独自伫立而已
我只是个有双重人格的生活奴隶
在这满是狼藉的房间中崩溃
你因贪婪而哽咽
你贪咽下疫病
我不会贪求免费的东西
你会为此付出代价
在这自由之岛
亦是那捏造的家园
我们被疾病吞噬折磨
我们落入坟墓
落入坟墓
落入坟墓
我不该多留
我不该多留但无法抛弃纵容你走
明明照面相对却只是我独自伫立而已
我只是个有双重人格的生活奴隶
在这满是狼藉的房间中崩溃
我不该多留但无法抛弃纵容你走
明明照面相对却只是我独自伫立而已
我只是个有双重人格的生活奴隶
在这满是狼藉的房间中崩溃
无法抛弃纵容你走
关闭再添薪燃火
我们终归尘土
火焰焚烧出骨灰
随风扬撒而死 我们私语
关闭再添薪燃火
我们终归尘土
火焰焚烧出骨灰
随风扬撒而死 我们私语
我无法抛弃纵容你走
明明照面相对却只是我独自伫立而已
我只是个有双重人格的生活走狗
在这满是狼藉的房间中崩溃
我不该多留但无法抛弃纵容你走
明明照面相对却只是我独自伫立而已
我只是个有双重人格的生活走狗
在这满是狼藉的房间中崩溃
我不该多留
但无法抛弃纵容你走
我无法抛弃纵容你走
