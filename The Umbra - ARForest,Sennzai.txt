The haven of the past is gone
by the ruthless knowledge
Where the fragile natural being is burend,
only the darkest shadow fills
Distant memories and lost records
They would know what I'll decide
Even under the imitated sky,
there must be the truth inside
Rise and sprout
Follow the created light
There's no wrong or right
until you arrive
at the umbra
Search and find
what they have turned a blind eye
I don't mind
What comes after this journey ends
Now it's time to face out
Rise and sprout
Follow the created light
There's no wrong or right
until you arrive
at The Umbra
Search and find
what they have turned a blind eye
I don't mind
what comes after this journey ends
Now it's time to face out!
无情的智识蔓入脑海
往昔的救所已然不再
自然的受造苦弱不堪
受缚于阴影流溢之处
失却记录与模糊回忆
将知晓我做下的决定
纵然处于虚假之天下
内里亦必有真实之物
生长、萌发
追寻着受造的光芒
此处未分对错
直到你的到来
于本影之中
探求、寻索
短视的目光所瞩之物
于我不值一顾
旅途终点后将会如何
如今已到了直面之刻
生长、萌发
追寻着受造的光芒
此处未分对错
直到你的到来
与本影之中
探求、寻索
短视的目光所瞩之物
于我不值一顾
旅途终点后将会如何
如今已到了直面之刻！
