Holding steady
So get ready for battle, Meteorn
Heat and fire we desire
To battle we are sworn
Ever burning
Ever yearning
Ever learning we'll always be
Are you siding with me?
Ever striding, are we
Innocence
It's my journey to perceive
Common sense,
Give me something to believe.
I don't remember when,
I don't remember how I fell
I can see
Only half way through the dark
Memory
Is a fire that needs a spark
If you remember when,
If you remember how
Just cover up the void in my heart
Cover me, I will cover you
I know tomorrow leads us on, in every way
The past has flown
Over the edge
And the paths along the sea
The battle has grown
We're all we can be
There is truth
There is right
That's the only thing we know
And the way we show we are enrolled in the minute
Live, like we're in it, to the end
And when the battle seems long
We soldier on
We will defend (Fight for this world)
Holding steady
So get ready for battle, Meteorn
Our resistance is existence
For battle we were born
We hope for tomorrow
Our purpose we borrow
It's the light of this mission seeing us to the dawn
Holding steady
So get ready for battle, Meteorn
Heat and fire we desire
To battle we are sworn
Ever burning
Ever yearning
Ever learning we'll always be
Are you siding with me?
Ever striding, are we
There's a wall
To surroundings that exist
Can't recall
But it's something that I miss
I don't remember why
I don't remember who I am
I'm alive
I fulfill a plan unknown
I revive a belief I'm not alone
If you remember why
If you remember who
This curious adventurer is
Talk to me, I will talk to you
The joy of living coupled with uncertainty
Is hard to face
But with the dreams
And the home you shared with us
We've found our place
And someone to trust
There is strength
There is might
That's the only road we choose
And the way we bruise all of the ones who oppose us
Everyone knows us, we are strong
We come together in heart
A work of art
We all belong (Fight for this world)
Holding steady
So get ready for battle, Meteorn
Our resistance is existence
For battle we were born
We hope for tomorrow
Our purpose we borrow
It's the light of this mission seeing us to the dawn
Holding steady
So get ready for battle, Meteorn
Heat and fire we desire
To battle we are sworn
Ever burning
Ever yearning
Ever learning we'll always be
Are you siding with me?
Ever striding, are we
Oh, with fate in your hands
Go, it is our destiny
Holding steady wo oh
So get ready wo oh
Holding steady wo oh
So get ready wo oh
Holding steady wo oh
So get ready wo oh
Holding steady wo oh
So get ready wo oh
临阵莫乱
准备迎战 渡星者
火与炽热是我等所期
奔赴战场是誓言所向
燃烧不息
渴求不止
钻研不懈
你愿否与我同行？
我们将一往无前
懵懂无识
这是我的认知之旅
世间常识
请告诉我何以为信
我记不起那是何时
也记不起是如何坠落
目能所及
唯有黑暗中半途前路
记忆之焰
仍需星火才可点明
若你记得那是何时
若你记得那段来路
就请掩藏住我心中空白
我也愿掩埋你心中空虚
我心知肚明 明日在唤我们前行
过往已烟消云散
跨过边境
和沿海之途
那战势蔓延滋长
我们正蓄势以待
真实尚存
正义仍在
是我们的唯一所知之事
也是我们活在此时此刻的明证
就投身于其中吧 直至最后一刻
而当战况焦灼时
我们将挺身而出
捍卫家园 (为这世界而战)
临阵莫乱
准备迎战 渡星者
此身是因抗争而存
此命是为征战而生
我们期盼明天
而那借来的目标
是这份使命 照拂我们迈向黎明的光
临阵莫乱
准备迎战 渡星者
火与炽热是我等所期
奔赴战场是誓言所向
燃烧不息
渴求不止
钻研不懈
你愿否与我同行？
我们将一往无前
一道障壁
存在于四面八方
回忆不起
可我却甚感怀念
我记不起这份原因
也记不起自己的身份
我活在当下
践行着未知的计划
我唤起自己 并不孤独的念头
若你记得这份原因
若你认得
这疑惑不解的冒险者
就请告诉我 我愿知无不言
生的喜悦 伴随着不确定
让人难以直面
但在你们分享的
梦想与家园之下
我们寻得了立足之处
与值得信赖之人
身怀力量
所向披靡
是我们的唯一所选之路
也是我们横扫一切阻拦的手段
我们的强大 人人皆知
我们心连起心
共同构筑为一件
瑰丽的杰作 (为这世界而战)
临阵莫乱
准备迎战 渡星者
此身是为抗争而存
此命是为征战而生
我们期盼明天
而那借来的目标
是这份使命 照拂我们迈向黎明的光
临阵莫乱
准备迎战 渡星者
火与炽热是我等所期
奔赴战场是誓言所向
燃烧不息
渴求不止
钻研不懈
你愿否与我同行？
我们将一往无前
就携着宿命前行吧
这是我们自己的命运
临阵莫乱
准备迎战
临阵莫乱
准备迎战
临阵莫乱
准备迎战
临阵莫乱
准备迎战
