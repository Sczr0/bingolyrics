Do you still remember when I couldn't see the way ?
Those worries kept on going on But it's finally over
I don't want to go to those worries anymore
I am doing what I can so I won't go that way now
We can't stop in to waste on time in this same place anymore
And we won't stay here forever
There's nothing you can say
Cause it's too late to close our position that we achieved
This is not the final destination, we are in the story, back again
この僕の中から離れて欠け続けていた
まだ何もかも…
I don't want to go to those worries anymore
I am doing what I can so I won't go that way now
今まで集めた想いが…
We can't stop in to waste on time in this same place anymore
And we won't stay here forever
There's nothing you can say
Cause it's too late to close our position that we achieved
This is not the final destination, we are in the story, back again
We will keep on trying on again and again
Whenever we did that, we felt like we were the one losing
We will do what we want
When I fall down, when I break down
I will always think again
When I fall down, when I break down
I will always think again
失った心が千切れかけても僕だって
全てを賭けてきたから
We can't stop in to waste on time in this same place anymore
And we won't stay here forever
There's nothing you can say
Cause it's too late to close our position that we achieved
This is not the final destination, we are in the story, back again
当我遗忘前程 耳边是否会想起你的叮咛
这些担虑依旧存在 但终将消却
我不愿再经受它们
我将尽我所能 才不致偏离轨道
我们不会在同一处跌倒
不会在此处滞留
你且无需多言
吾辈至此 恐已暮已
但这并非终点 若想被写入史诗 我们需要重头再来
我的心已经残损
早已空无一物
我不愿再经受担虑
我不愿再经受担虑
我将尽我所能 才不致偏离轨道
芜杂思绪充斥脑海
我们不会在同一处跌倒
我们不会在同一处跌倒
不会在此处滞留
你且无需多言
吾辈至此 恐已暮已
但这并非终点 若想被写入史诗 我们需要重头再来
我们不断地尝试
当我做这件事时 就像一个迷失的旅人
可我的身体只遵从我的内心
当我坠落 当我跌堕
我一定会沉心思考
当我坠落 当我跌堕
我一定会沉心思考
即使心被纵裂横切
也要奋力一搏
我们不会在同一处跌倒
我们不会在同一处跌倒
不会在此处滞留
你且无需多言
吾辈至此 恐已暮已
但这并非终点 我们终将被载入史册 那么重头再来
