TALK THAT SLICK TALK
You can say all kind of shit
Run when you see me
'Cause I got two clips, b***h
Going through stages
Never asking favors
'Cause we are the greatest
(We are the greatest)
TALK THAT SLICK TALK
You can say all kind of shit
Run when you see me
'Cause I got two clips, b***h
Going through stages
Never asking favors
'Cause we are the greatest
(We are the greatest)
You always tried to be that fly
Sitting on the wall not minding anyone
Out of sight
You got to keep on moving, don't you know?
He was another passerby
Something 'bout him wasn't right
Don't wait for fate this time
You got to keep on moving, don't you know?
Party in that crazy bar, and I go super-extra hard
Everybody overewhelm it bring them jumping on the game
Treat this rap shit like a job, and I go super-extra hard
Bet you never ever heard a flow that's half as rad as ours
Party in that crazy bar, and I go super-extra hard
Everybody overewhelm it bring them jumping on the game
Treat this rap shit like a job, and I go super-extra hard
Bet you never ever heard a flow that's half as rad as ours
You got to keep on moving, don't you know?
Don't you know?
Playing with the cards you were given
There's no way out
TALK THAT SLICK TALK
You can say all kind of shit
Run when you see me
'Cause I got two clips, b***h
Going through stages
Never asking favors
'Cause we are the greatest
(We are the greatest)
