Living in a crazy world
Following the path that always twists and turns
Gave up on your sanity to hide behind the devil
Cuz you think you'll live forever
Saying that you're getting old
Out there thinking that you're in the world alone
No one ever told you that you have to live for something
Or in the end, you will be nothing
It's too cold
Standing in the middle of the downfall
Looking in The mirror cuz it's only you
That you have to lose
Heading back with only one way
Trying to stop from running But you can't wait
Bury all the evidence
You'll only learn
When you crash and burn
Fire can make things more wonderful
HOUSE MUSIC
Ha~
Red Light, Oh
That you have to lose
When you crash and burn
Machine gun
Oh
When you crash and burn
Oh
When you crash and burn
Burn
Burn
活在疯狂的世界中
遵循着永远蜿蜒交错的道路
放弃理智来躲在恶魔背后
因你觉得能够永生
说着你在老去
想着你在这世界孑然一身
无人告诉你生而为何
最终你将一无是处
寒冷难耐
站在崩溃的中央
看向镜子中 因为只有你
你只得失去
回头走向唯一的出路
试图停下奔跑的脚步，但你却无法等待
埋藏所有证据
你只会吸取教训
于你崩溃燃烧之时
火能让事物变的更美好
好  核  音  乐
哈～
红灯~
你只得失去
在你崩溃燃烧之时
机  关  枪
~
在你崩溃燃烧之时
~
在你崩溃燃烧之时
燃烧
燃烧
