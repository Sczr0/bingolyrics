The neon light projecting on my face.
As if I am in another world.
Something's that flashed before my eyes.
Is what I see is true?
Fragments rush into my brain.
I feel fidgety and empty.
Is that tears in my eyelids.
I will sleep forever now.
I'm caught in a loop now.
Flash in my memory were you.
I'm crying that because of you.
I want to escape.
Please point me a way.
so where can find my future?

Fragments rush into my brain.
I feel fidgety and empty.
Is that tears in my eyelids.
I will sleep forever now.
The moment when the world disappears from my sight.
My mechanical body is still working hard.
Throat is hurting, I can't say anything.
I still can't believe,is that the truth.
The heartbeat is gradually accelerating.
But my arms can't be lifted once again.
I have always wanted to be reset.
No way to retreat…
Can someone tell me the truth please？
So where can find my future?
Flash in my memory were you.
I'm crying that because of you.
I want to escape.
Please point me a way.

霓虹灯投射在我脸上
仿佛我置身幻境
在我眼前闪烁的东西
是真实的吗
碎片涌入脑海
使我烦闷而空虚
察觉到眼角的泪光
我将长眠不醒
此刻我陷入困境
在记忆深处浮现的是你
我因你而哭号
我想挣脱桎梏
请为我指明前路
哪里能找寻到我的未来呢
霓虹灯投射在我脸上
仿佛我置身幻境
在我眼前闪烁的东西
是真实的吗
碎片涌入脑海
使我烦闷而空虚
察觉到眼角的泪光
我将长眠不醒
世界从我眼前消失的那一瞬
我机械的躯干仍在不停运转
我无语哽咽
依旧不相信这就是事实
心跳逐渐加快
但我的手臂已无力抬起
我渴望被重置
但没有退路可言
有人能向我吐露真言吗
哪里能找寻到我的未来呢
在记忆深处浮现的是你
我因你而哭号
我想挣脱桎梏
请为我指明前路
