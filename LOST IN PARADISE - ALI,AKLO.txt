Gotta get it homie gotta move it
If you gonna do it then 他二の次
Everybody just talk nobody really do it
なんならやるまでしとけよ秘密に
誰かと確認なんて不要
自分のジャッジだけで
Break the walls
ド派手なfakeやろうより
Coolにlowにprove them wrong
I won't give up the fight in my life
Cause my life is living for love
I won't give up the fight in my life
Stand off and groove on time
Tokyo prison
I'm going to relight your feelings
When times get too rough
Night and day are fading
I'm going to relight your feelings
There's no time to explain
(Access to your love)
Oh nothing is for real
That's how you make me feel
I got beaten stompin'on love
Pick up my wasted time
God might understand
Nobody can hold me down
I won't give up the fight in my life
Cause my life is living for love
I won't give up the fight in my life
Stand off and groove on time
Tokyo prison
I'm going to relight your feelings
When times get rough
Night and day are blending
I'm going to relight your feelings
Light up every last one of them
(Access to your love)
またtime is ticking
唯一平等wasting no more
計画ならdoneするまでnot real
The illest 頂く称号
誰かの予想軽々超えてはるか向こう
I've done it あれもこれもそれも
もしdownしてもupして
On and on
東京hell からparadise
そりゃ勝ちとるまでならgotta fight
今更やわなかけ
できるわけねえだろぶちかませ
頭の中から現実に
変換していく綿密に
眠らずaction 0時過ぎ
このlifeが生み出す芸術品
Oh nothing is for real
That's how you make me feel
I got beaten stompin'on love
Pick up my wasted time
God might understand
Nobody can hold me down
I won't give up the fight in my life
Cause my life is living for love
I won't give up the fight in my life
Stand off and groove on time
Tokyo prison
I'm going to relight your feelings
When times get rough
Night and day are fading
I'm going to relight your feelings
There's no time to explain
Lost in paradise
Night and day are fading out
When times get rough
Access to your love
Lost in paradise
Night and day are fading out
Keep on dancing now
Hey hey
Tokyo prison
I'm going to relight your feelings
Night and day are blending
I'm going to relight your feelings
Light up every last one of them
(Access to your love)
Lost in paradise
Night and day are fading out
When the times get rough
Access to your love
Lost in paradise
Night and day are fading out
Keep on dancing now
Hey hey hey hey yeah
