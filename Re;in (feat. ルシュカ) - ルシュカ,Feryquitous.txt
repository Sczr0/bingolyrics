My mind was trapped in deep darkness
我的意识被囚于暗黑深渊
You would never think of me
君对我永无挂念
Even I could feel you near
纵然我能感受到君伴身侧
Everything got cold and my fingers froze
万物凋零，纤指凝霜
The world seemed like a piano without a player
这凡世正如无人弹奏的钢琴
……
I never knew you
我不曾解君意
Though I thought I knew so much,ah
纵然我认为我已通晓万物，啊
A drop of tears bounced
一滴泪珠弹落
But I didn't flounce away
但我不愿转身离去
Then I lost my sight again
视线再度失焦
And I think of you
我仍在思念着君
But I know that my thoughts would never reach to you
纵使我知道，我们之间注定不能心意相通
Please don't let me vanish
也请君不让我归于虚无
Even if no one wishes me to stay here
纵然遭人唾弃，此处无容身之地
Please forgive me
也请君能宽恕我
……
Why did I have to feel so empty?
为何我要承受此般空虚？
I thought I had it all
明明我已经掌控了一切
Find me in the deep black forest
让我们再会于黑森林深处
I'm about to fall
我即将沉沦消散
I see the Death before me
我的眼前只有黑暗
Let him have it all
就让君夺走这一切
Find me in the deep black forest
让我们再会于黑森林深处
I'm about to fall
我即将沉沦消散
……
My mind was trapped in deep darkness
我的意识被囚于暗黑深渊
