My mind was trapped in deep darkness
You would never think of me
Even I could feel you near
Everything got cold and my fingers froze
The world seemed like a piano without a player
……
I never knew you
Though I thought I knew so much,ah
A drop of tears bounced
But I didn't flounce away
Then I lost my sight again
And I think of you
But I know that my thoughts would never reach to you
Please don't let me vanish
Even if no one wishes me to stay here
Please forgive me
……
Why did I have to feel so empty?
I thought I had it all
Find me in the deep black forest
I'm about to fall
I see the Death before me
Let him have it all
Find me in the deep black forest
I'm about to fall
……
My mind was trapped in deep darkness
我的意识被囚于暗黑深渊
君对我永无挂念
纵然我能感受到君伴身侧
万物凋零，纤指凝霜
这凡世正如无人弹奏的钢琴
我不曾解君意
纵然我认为我已通晓万物，啊
一滴泪珠弹落
但我不愿转身离去
视线再度失焦
我仍在思念着君
纵使我知道，我们之间注定不能心意相通
也请君不让我归于虚无
纵然遭人唾弃，此处无容身之地
也请君能宽恕我
为何我要承受此般空虚？
明明我已经掌控了一切
让我们再会于黑森林深处
我即将沉沦消散
我的眼前只有黑暗
就让君夺走这一切
让我们再会于黑森林深处
我即将沉沦消散
我的意识被囚于暗黑深渊
