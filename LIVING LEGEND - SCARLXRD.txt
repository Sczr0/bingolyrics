Go **** yourself till you bleed
Go
I don't give a ****
I'll take what I want
All the way to graves
**** this I'm done
Feeling like I threw my ****ing life away
Feeling like I threw my ****ing life away
Better relieving all the stress that I'm packing
Presuming all that's what I'm under
Energy costing cause I've been having lashes
Running up on enemies
I'm on a level up
Easy bro
Bite your tongue
I'm gonna go tell em I'm really loud
Easy bro
Easy bro
I feeling the surface on easy road
All of my problems are solved
I see the place where I go
Watch out for me
Imma glow
See on my wrist
You broke
If I'm still cutting you off
B***h you making me slow
I wanna fake frost
These niggas act rich and they broke
Serving the valley
Say no more
Putting me in when I kicked that door
When I'm on the run in and set them straight
They wanna take your regular job
All of these lyrical
They are not minimal
Still I'm so sick
I might vomit and let it go
I am the lyrical
Never so minimal
Too late to let it go
They are not rare enough uh
Taped in my brain
I'm connected to flaw
Taking the business and making it blow
Tearing my face and my neighbor will fit
Leaping around
I'm taking a jump
I don't give a **** no more
I gonna snap all day til I'm dead or bored
Never live blast face
Then l'd live more
Uh
I'mma ****ing wreck it
I'm a living legend
I'm a living legend
I'm a living legend
You're a walking corpse
I'm a living legend
I'm a living legend
I'm a living legend
You're a walking corpse
Easy bro
Bite your tongue
I'm gonna go tell em I'm really loud
Easy bro
Easy bro
I feeling the surface on easy road
Easy bro
Bite your tongue
I'm gonna go tell em I'm really loud
Easy bro
Easy bro
I feeling the surface on easy road
How that boy hate on the craft
I'm the best hit on the town
Sipping and yell like a drunk
I'm on the road to rob ya
Seal my shit down
We don't ever need a grave
I've been dying in church
I can **** him up worse
Go **** yourself till you bleed
Go
I don't give a ****
I'll take what I want
All the way to graves
**** this I'm done
Feeling like I threw my ****ing life away
Feeling like I threw my ****ing life away
I don't give a ****
I'll take what I want
All the way to graves
**** this I'm done
Feeling like I threw my ****ing life away
Feeling like I threw my ****ing life away
YEAH
