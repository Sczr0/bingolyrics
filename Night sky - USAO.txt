Lights are out and there's sweat in your embrace,
There is one other thing I dare,
Lights are out and it's time to leave your faces,
There is another dare.
Just keep on rockin'!
Lights are out and there's sweat in your embrace,
Lights are out and it's time to leave your faces,
There is another dare.
And our silence is too much.
And our silence is too much.
Lights are out and there's sweat in your embrace,
Lights are out and there's sweat in your embrace,
There is one other thing I dare,
Lights are out and it's time to leave your faces,
And our silence is too much.
And our silence is too much.
Lights are out and there's sweat in your embrace,
There is one other thing I dare,
Lights are out and it's time to leave your faces,
There is another dare.
And our silence is too much.
And our silence is too much.
灯光骤灭,汗水滞留于你的怀中.
仍有它物需要我的眷顾.
灯光骤灭,视线该离开你的脸颊.
另一个挑战翘首以待.
"Just keep on rockin!"
灯光骤灭,汗水滞留于你的怀中.
灯光骤灭,视线该离开你的脸颊.
另一个挑战翘首以待.
你我相视无言.
你我心照不宣.
灯光骤灭,汗水滞留于你的怀中.

仍有它物需要我的眷顾.
