With a face screaming down bad?

GROSS!
到死为止 都要当一个纯洁小男孩吗？
爱 叭叭叭叭……
爱恋和喜欢
其实就是一个东西
并不是唯一
想跟你玩个游戏
“非常抱歉><”
你真的想听我说出这句话吗？
没门！
别因为这个就郁郁寡欢
行 行 行
停下！
难道不知道“克制所有欲望”是你的首要准则吗？
（早就告诉过你）
只是为了乐子而已才不得已给你我的爱啊
（你怎么敢）
决心先生
您可以在右手边找到出口喔
哦天
你真的确定今晚要留下来？
HOP！
STEP！
开下一局！
所以
如果出现的话就让它保持摇摆
来点POP的感觉 就这样继续下去
可别变成一个只会嫉妒的受气包哇
想尝尝我嘛？
别那么怂啊？
如果你想要一些
如果你寂寞的话
快变得幸运
快变得幸运
讨厌恋爱
但爱是我的全部人生
到死为止 你都要当一个纯洁小男孩吗？
出现的话就让它保持摇摆
是不是难过了？
戴着一副“好坏”的表情？
“爱你
