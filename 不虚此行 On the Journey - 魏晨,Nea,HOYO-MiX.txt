We venture through the cosmic sea
A thousand light-years, wild and free
We dance beneath the galaxy
Then will you be with me?
Hand in hand, we’ll face our fears
Conquering doubts that linger near
Together we’ll find a way
To brighter, better days
Exploration, begins!
Moving on, to paths unknown
To break into daylight
No sleep until sunrise
Riding on, our roads afar
We’re rising high, into the sky,
There we go, till we know
Exploration
Exploration begins!
Catching on, our paths unknown,
To sink into daylight
Break into the moonlight
Life goes on, through tides of time
Get in the line, to dream alive
In our souls, do we know?
Catching on, our paths unknown,
To sink into daylight
Break into the moonlight
Life goes on, through tides of time
Get in the line, to dream alive
In our souls, do we know?
On the journey
On the journey
