Your lie lies on frozen lips.
As pale petals bout to fall off.
Hopefully I'll get used to this
hoax that our lovemade.
Wind whines through broken tips.
As our memories die off.
Hopefully you'll get used to my
Hugs meaning goodbye.
Loves me,loves me not.
Tried to get a rise out of
magnolia petals but soon scattered them over you.
Watch me fall and drop away.
...
Dropped me bad...
...
Dropped me bad...
...
Dropped me bad...
Full of tears shall be stream.
Life ends up La-cri-mo-sa.
Shattered heart, burnt my life out.
Why you still my remedy.
Loves me,loves me not.
Tried to get a rise out of
magnolia petals but soon scattered them over you.
Watch me fall and drop away.
Hear me cry.
Our love's dead dried.
你的谎言在苍白的花瓣凋零之时
摊在你那冰冻的嘴唇上
希望我已经习惯
这因爱而生的骗局
风通过残破的废墟
泣诉著我们消亡的记忆
希望你已经习惯
拥抱象征着离别
对我还有眷恋之情吗
你锲而不舍地追问著
不久木兰花瓣已经遍布了你的身旁
你眼睁睁看著我点点陨落
泪终将汇成河
我的生命只成为一阵哭泣
我破碎的心灵把我的生命烧尽
为什么你还是我的解药
对我还有眷恋之情吗?
你锲而不舍地追问著
不久木兰花瓣已经遍布了你的身旁
你眼睁睁看著我点点陨落
听着我的哭声
只因我们的感情已终焉
