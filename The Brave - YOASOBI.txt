Many days tinted in fairy tale scenes
Have arrived at the end, proof we have seen
I cut out and choose from a trip so long
A little passage I review
Tale of what's taken place right on this field
Shadows of manifested pain and woe
There was a hero who took out all foes
A little-journey memory with you
No more pages left in that story
Our hero goes into slumber, deep
Leaving behind a veil of peace for all
Saving the dwellers of this land
The flow of time erases without mercy
And erodes all memories and hues
Even the traces left in life are now rusting as time ensues
And yet, I keep all your hopes
All the words and wishes, courage you owned
Still dwell inside me, and even now in my heart
Keep living through
Odyssey we shared, on the same path
And nothing more to that
So it should have been, but suddenly I was wondering
All those tears rolling down my cheeks
Why do they come out and fall?
I wanna find out
And still even right now, if I engage in the journey we went about again
Though I am no longer walking next to you
One day, I know I'll find the truth
And now that story unfolds into a journey that, alone, I set out to
I meet the locals of every town I stop in
They all are recalling the person that you were
Unwavering kindness is spoken of you
Acting all cool in everything you'd do
Here and there, we can find scattered symbols around
Manifesting battle we won for peace
And even that was left for me so one day
I wouldn't find myself alone, becoming lonely
And I call to mind every moment of our journey
When I see the signs left in these scenes
Many days tinted in fairy tale scenes
Have arrived at the end, proof we have seen
It was that moment, our fateful meeting
One percent of the journey, spent with me
Even if your courage is swept away to the distance
And the wind has taken what everybody can recall
I will bring you on with me into the future's light
I've taken your hand in mine
I know it all began right at that time
Mundane everyday signs
The moments ignited in laughter with you remain
My reflections of those times go on as brightly shining scenes
I wanna find out
And still even right now
Looking back, it's you, standing and so proud
Evermore gently smiling right at me, without a sound
I'm perceiving you around
Now a new beginning has begun to be and
In this land that you protected and kept in safety
These budding lives are with me on this journey
童话般的幸福时光
终于在我们的见证下迎来结局
我从漫长旅途中挑选出一个章节
细细品读
它讲述着这片土地上发生的一切
那时 痛苦与悲伤如阴影笼罩
一位英雄挺身而出对坑恶敌
这是一段旅程 也是一段回忆 我与你一同感悟
这个故事已经讲完
我们的英雄陷入深深沉睡
为世界留下一片祥和平静
拯救了这片土地上无数生命
世间荏苒 无情抹去一切
风蚀了记忆 洗去了色彩
甚至最后的一丝痕迹也因时间而锈迹斑斑
即便如此 我依然记得你所有的期盼
你的话语 你的愿望 你的勇气
依然珍藏在我心里 就算是此时此刻
也鲜活依旧
我们踏上同一条路 同一段冒险征程
如此简单纯粹
仿佛一切早已注定  突然间  我思考着
流过面颊的滚烫泪水
究竟为何夺眶而出？ 为何落下？
我想找到答案
如果现在我要重新走你我曾经的旅程
虽然身边已经没有你的脚步陪伴
我知道  总有一天  我会找到真相
如今  那个故事化作一段旅途  我独自出发
每到一座城镇  我和每一位居民交谈
他们都还记得你曾经的模样
他们都说你心中的仁义善良从未动摇
你的一举一动都云淡风轻
小镇上随处可见那时留下的痕迹
记录着我们为和平而战的岁月
时至今日依然清晰可辨
所以未来  我不会再感到孤独寂寞
我会回忆我们旅程的分分秒秒
只要我看到那些奇妙印迹
童话般的幸福时光
终于在我们的见证下引来结局
那一刻是我们命中注定的相会
我们的旅程才刚刚走过百分之一
哪怕你的勇气已经随时间飘向远方
风也带走了记忆中的所有
我会带你踏上旅途   步入光明未来
我牵起你的手
我知道那一刻是一切的起点
尽管生活平平淡淡
与你一起欢笑的日子将驻留心底
那些时光将成为闪耀的日子
我想要找到答案
即便此时此刻
回头望去   你依然昂然站立
向我温柔微笑   一切尽在不言中
我感受到你就在我身边
现在   全新的故事已经开启
在这片你曾经捍卫守护的土地上
新的萌芽焕发勃勃生机   伴我同行
