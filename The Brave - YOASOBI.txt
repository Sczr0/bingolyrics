Many days tinted in fairy tale scenes
童话般的幸福时光
Have arrived at the end, proof we have seen
终于在我们的见证下迎来结局
I cut out and choose from a trip so long
我从漫长旅途中挑选出一个章节
A little passage I review
细细品读
Tale of what's taken place right on this field
它讲述着这片土地上发生的一切
Shadows of manifested pain and woe
那时 痛苦与悲伤如阴影笼罩
There was a hero who took out all foes
一位英雄挺身而出对坑恶敌
A little-journey memory with you
这是一段旅程 也是一段回忆 我与你一同感悟
No more pages left in that story
这个故事已经讲完
Our hero goes into slumber, deep
我们的英雄陷入深深沉睡
Leaving behind a veil of peace for all
为世界留下一片祥和平静
Saving the dwellers of this land
拯救了这片土地上无数生命
The flow of time erases without mercy
世间荏苒 无情抹去一切
And erodes all memories and hues
风蚀了记忆 洗去了色彩
Even the traces left in life are now rusting as time ensues
甚至最后的一丝痕迹也因时间而锈迹斑斑
And yet, I keep all your hopes
即便如此 我依然记得你所有的期盼
All the words and wishes, courage you owned
你的话语 你的愿望 你的勇气
Still dwell inside me, and even now in my heart
依然珍藏在我心里 就算是此时此刻
Keep living through
也鲜活依旧
Odyssey we shared, on the same path
我们踏上同一条路 同一段冒险征程
And nothing more to that
如此简单纯粹
So it should have been, but suddenly I was wondering
仿佛一切早已注定  突然间  我思考着
All those tears rolling down my cheeks
流过面颊的滚烫泪水
Why do they come out and fall?
究竟为何夺眶而出？ 为何落下？
I wanna find out
我想找到答案
And still even right now, if I engage in the journey we went about again
如果现在我要重新走你我曾经的旅程
Though I am no longer walking next to you
虽然身边已经没有你的脚步陪伴
One day, I know I'll find the truth
我知道  总有一天  我会找到真相
And now that story unfolds into a journey that, alone, I set out to
如今  那个故事化作一段旅途  我独自出发
I meet the locals of every town I stop in
每到一座城镇  我和每一位居民交谈
They all are recalling the person that you were
他们都还记得你曾经的模样
Unwavering kindness is spoken of you
他们都说你心中的仁义善良从未动摇
Acting all cool in everything you'd do
你的一举一动都云淡风轻
Here and there, we can find scattered symbols around
小镇上随处可见那时留下的痕迹
Manifesting battle we won for peace
记录着我们为和平而战的岁月
And even that was left for me so one day
时至今日依然清晰可辨
I wouldn't find myself alone, becoming lonely
所以未来  我不会再感到孤独寂寞
And I call to mind every moment of our journey
我会回忆我们旅程的分分秒秒
When I see the signs left in these scenes
只要我看到那些奇妙印迹
Many days tinted in fairy tale scenes
童话般的幸福时光
Have arrived at the end, proof we have seen
终于在我们的见证下引来结局
It was that moment, our fateful meeting
那一刻是我们命中注定的相会
One percent of the journey, spent with me
我们的旅程才刚刚走过百分之一
Even if your courage is swept away to the distance
哪怕你的勇气已经随时间飘向远方
And the wind has taken what everybody can recall
风也带走了记忆中的所有
I will bring you on with me into the future's light
我会带你踏上旅途   步入光明未来
I've taken your hand in mine
我牵起你的手
I know it all began right at that time
我知道那一刻是一切的起点
Mundane everyday signs
尽管生活平平淡淡
The moments ignited in laughter with you remain
与你一起欢笑的日子将驻留心底
My reflections of those times go on as brightly shining scenes
那些时光将成为闪耀的日子
I wanna find out
我想要找到答案
And still even right now
即便此时此刻
Looking back, it's you, standing and so proud
回头望去   你依然昂然站立
Evermore gently smiling right at me, without a sound
向我温柔微笑   一切尽在不言中
I'm perceiving you around
我感受到你就在我身边
Now a new beginning has begun to be and
现在   全新的故事已经开启
In this land that you protected and kept in safety
在这片你曾经捍卫守护的土地上
These budding lives are with me on this journey
新的萌芽焕发勃勃生机   伴我同行
