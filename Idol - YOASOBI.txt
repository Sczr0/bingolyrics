Couldn't beat her smile, it stirred up all the media
Secret side, I wanna know it
So mysterious
Even that elusive side, part of her controlled area
Complete and perfect
All you say is a bunch of lies
Dear miss genius idol, unmatched
What did you eat today?
What book do you love?
Whenever you go out for fun, tell me, where do you go?
Haven't eaten anything
It's a secret, unknown
Any questions you're facing, always acting so vaguely
So unconcerned, although you brightly glow
Any seemingly unveiled secrets are as sweet as honey
Confusing, why, why, why?
Essential lie, lie, lie
So, what is your type of guy?
Any partner?
So, now, answer this
"I don't have any idea how I could love anyone"
"I don't seem to know what it signifies"
Cannot find out if it's true or it's a lie
Once again, there's somebody who's fallen for the words and cues
Made him lose his head over you
That emotion melts all hearts, all eyes on you
Cause you are perfect, the most ultimate idol
Unrivaled, will not appear again
It's the brightest star reborn, yes, indeed
Using that smiling face
That "I love you" again
Now, everybody is lured and captivated by you
The pupil that you got
The words you vocalize
Even when untrue, it's your perfected Ai
Right, right, we all know she's very special, yes
We had lost the fight before it started, so impressed
Miss I'm such a star
We're serving as support to her grace
Cannot tell me everything was because of her
No, it's not right
Out of line
How can we not feel jealous while being around
It's not a joke, you know, right?
So, I cannot forgive you for that
Completely deny
Imperfect you that I sight
Myself, no pardon allowed
I won't allow anyone if it's not you, strongest of all
That emotion seized all hearts worshiping you
Yes, indeed
So strong, it's you, unrivaled idol
There cannot be weaknesses to find
The brightest star is residing in you
The gaps and shortcomings, don't show’em
Dammit, dammit
Parts nobody wants to know should remain hidden
One and only
If it's different, no way, no way
Such a true love, it's the realest Ai
Showing this smile, my own weapon
Boiling media
Keeping everything about my secret deep inside
"I'm in love with you," my career is built on such a lie
It's the way I know to show my love, without a doubt
Running down, my sweat is flowing
Cleanest aqua, right?
Ruby hidden under my eyelids where it resides
I sing and dance around
Look at me, I'm Maria
So, lying surely is the greatest kind of love
I recall no one that loved me whole before
And I've not been in love with anybody before
Now, the lies I'm making up
I'm hoping that a day comes when they all become true
And I keep wishing they do
One day, I will hold everything that I pursue
Yes, I am so greedy, true voracious idol
So, sincerely, what I'm wishing for is to love each of you with all my heart
And so, today, I lie again
The words I vocalize inside of me
I'm wishing that one day they come true
Up to this day, I've not been able to let you
And you hear me saying those meaningful words
I said it at last
I know it's not a lie as I'm voicing these words
I love you
她露出笑容吸引所有媒体的目光
藏起的一面 让人想去知晓
那神秘的一面
就连冒失的模样 也都尽在她的领域
完整且完美
满口谎言的你便是
无与伦比的天才偶像大人
今天你吃了些什么？
喜欢的书是？
如果你想出去玩的话 会去哪里？
今天我什么也没吃
那个保密 不能告诉你
无论被问到什么 都蒙混过关
你是那么淡然 又那么璀璨
任何看似揭开的秘密 都宛若蜂蜜般甜蜜
令人困惑 想不清为何
本质却是谎言构筑
喜欢的类型是？
对象是？
来吧 现在回答我
“我不知道该怎么去爱一个人”
“我似乎并不知晓爱意味着什么”
说出的话语真假难辨
但又一次 让他人因你这句话而沦陷
让他为你失去理智
那份情感融化了所有人的心 夺走所有人的目光
你便是完美且究极的偶像
无人能敌 从今往后不会再出现
没错 你便是那一等星的来生转世
你露出那份笑容
再次说出“我爱你”
如今 无论是谁都将化作你的俘虏
你的双眸
你所说的话
即便全是谎言 那也是完美的爱
对对 我们知道那个孩子是最特别的
我等从一开始便早已败北 令人钦佩
她是“超级明星”小姐
我们就只是她的陪衬
别和我说一切都托了那个孩子的福
这完全不对
性格欠妥
我们之中怎可能无人嫉妒
这也并非玩笑 你心知肚明不是吗？
正因如此我难以饶恕你
无法饶恕那个
并非完美的你
我无法原谅这样的自己
除你以外 我都难以认可谁能更胜他人
那份情感让所有人都诚心将你奉作信仰
是的 没错
你正是那最强且无敌的偶像
弱点在你身上绝不存在
一等星寄于你身
绝不能表现出破绽与缺点
真是该死
不让他人看到不想知晓的一面
那份独一无二
倘若无法保持 那绝对不行
这才是我真正且真实的爱
露出擅长的笑容
将媒体一同惹沸
将秘密藏于自己内心
“我爱你” 我的事业建立于这句谎言之上
毫无疑问 这正属于是我表达爱的方式
就连奔跑后滴落的汗水
也是美丽的蓝宝石 不是吗？
那双眼帘下隐藏着红宝石
酣歌恒舞的我
看啊 我就如那玛丽亚
所以 谎言便是至高无上的爱
记忆中我从未被他人所爱
我也未爱着他人
我所编制的这虚渺谎言
我期望总有一日会化作真实
我如此坚信
总有一日 我必将得到一切
我就是如此贪心 真正贪婪的偶像
所以 我真诚地希望全心全意地爱你们每一个人
所以今天我依旧会口诉谎言
我打心底期望这谎言
总有一日能够化作真实
时至今日 我从未对你说出口
你也从未听见我对你说出这个词
终于得以说出口
我说出口时我便知晓 这句话绝对不是谎言
我爱你们
