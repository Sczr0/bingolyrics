Ooh Ahh ahh ahh
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and don't go
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Only time I feel pain, when I feel in love
That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only time you come my mind, when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really  alone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feeling really lost, ducking all the attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Nigga really wanna die in the night time, uh
Nigga really wanna die in the night time, uh
Nigga really wanna die in the night time(Don't go)
Don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and don't go
Don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and don't go
Ooh yeah yeah yeah
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and don't
清醒起来，千万不要堕入梦魇
厌倦了我可怜的狭隘思维的局限
受够了那交织的可怖谎言的欺骗
腻烦了在这可悲的游戏人生中浪费时间
我真想在黑夜降临之时得到安眠
爱意愈是深沉，心碎时就会觉得这世界愈是残忍
这就是为何我麻木无感即使我脸上刻满了岁月的伤痕
只有当我感到孤独时你才会出现在我的脑中
这就是为何在漫漫长夜中我从未真正孤身一人
女人们来了又去，可从未真心相爱
因为她们点燃了欲火后又逃之夭夭
我曾迷失了自我，竭力躲避着他人的依恋与爱慕
我不想走出居所，因为我痛恨这世俗
我不愿出门，只因不甘于与世俗同流合污
厌倦了我可怜的狭隘思维的局限
受够了那交织的可怖谎言的欺骗
腻烦了在这可悲的游戏人生中浪费时间
我真想在黑夜降临之时得到安眠
厌倦了我可怜的狭隘思维的局限
受够了那交织的可怖谎言的欺骗
腻烦了在这可悲的游戏人生中浪费时间
我真想在黑夜降临之时得到安眠
厌倦了我可怜的狭隘思维的局限
受够了那交织的可怖谎言的欺骗
腻烦了在这可悲的游戏人生中浪费时间
我真想在黑夜降临之时得到安眠
每个人死于对自我无尽的束缚并且永无止境地活在其中
这世上有多少人在夜幕降临时有过放弃生命的念头
我在浮沉的人世间疲于奔命地求得生存
我在漫长的光阴中绝望徒劳地随波逐流
我在飘渺的岁月里努力找寻着生的希望
不要陷入沉睡
抬起头来，不要逃避现实
不要堕入梦魇
抬起头来，这世界还值得留恋
不要再迷茫忐忑
不要再束缚自我
