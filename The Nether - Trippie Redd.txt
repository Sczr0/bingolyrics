If you happened to be found already
You won't ever have be, be afraid
If you happened to be found already
'Cause I think about you now, I try
Can't get you off my mind
No matter how hard you try
Can't get you off my mind
Yeah, I think you happened in my past life
Exit turns was really scary to me last night
I'm seein' ghosts and every day is like our last life
Heaven or Hell, I'm on my last flight
I do one-fifty to the dash right
I'm blown' dope, it's too much smoke
And I ain't got nowhere to ash right
I spit my feelings to a glass mic
That boy get too much cheese
How you expectin' not to attract mice?
Don't do good with social advice
Don't wanna be the one to pick your brain
Wanna be the one to pick and choose a different pinky ring like everyday
Heaven-sent off Mary Jane, Richard Mille, keep it plain
A different nigga, a different day
Feel invincible, I can't feel a thing
Invincible, I can't feel the pain
Invincible, I can't feel it, feel it
Feel invincible, I can't feel a thing
Invincible, I can't feel the pain
Invincible, I can't feel it, feel it
如果你碰巧被找到了
你真的没必要害怕
如果你碰巧被找到了
因为我满脑子都是你 我试试
无法让你离开我的大脑
不管你怎么努力
都无法让你离开我的大脑
你在我过往的生活里时常出现
失败的阴影就如同夜里的噩梦
每日鬼影浮现 如同生命倒数
选择天堂亦或地狱 飞向未知的航班
时速150 油门踩到底
药物不离嘴 烟味太重了
也找不到烟灰缸了害
在玻璃麦克风上舌灿金莲
票子太多
难免招人嫉妒
少些无用社交
一时灵魂出窍
每日带上不同款式的钻戒
她若Mary Jane般美丽 手戴镶钻Richard Mille
在某个不知姓名的女孩身边苏醒
战无不胜 我失去知觉
不可战胜 我失去痛觉
天下无敌 我感受不到
坚定不移 我失去知觉
万夫莫敌 我失去痛觉
所向披靡 我感受不到
