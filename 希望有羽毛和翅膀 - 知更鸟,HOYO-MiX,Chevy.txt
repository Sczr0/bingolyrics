We rise together as our destiny unfolds
We face the darkness and our trials are yet untold
Through the shadows of despair
Oh, in silence, hopes we share
To chase our dreams that we’ve declared
We glimpse, through our eyes
Yet fools, blind our sights
Can’t make what they say
We’ll find our way, we’ll find our way
Heads up! The wheels are spinning
Across the plains, in valleys deep
To dawn, the wheels that sing
An unending dream!
Heads up! the tracks are running
Across the plains, where shadows hide
We run, we stride~
In the face of fear and plight, and yet we hold our ground
In life we stand, and strive, our victory is found
And the storms we’ve weathered through
And we hope in the light of truth
To break free from chains, and come anew
Heads up! The wheels are spinning
Across the plains, in valleys deep
To dawn, the wheels that sing
An unending dream!
Heads up! the tracks are running
Across the plains, where shadows hide
We run; we stride~
Heads up! A steady rhythm
A destination that’s ever near
It comes! Stride to our kingdom
And see the light of day
Heads up! the wheels are singing
The whispers and secrets they’d keep
To hope! We bound~
Break free, we chased our dreams, beneath the starry night
In the face of god, we rose, as one
