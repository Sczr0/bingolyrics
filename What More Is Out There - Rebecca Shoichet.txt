What More Is Out There

I've walked through all these halls before

I've been in and out of every door, oh-whoa-oh
所有房间都已进出过
There's nothin' in this school that I don't know
整座学院,我了如指掌
In every class, my grade's the best
每门学科得分最高
The highest score on every test
每次测验成绩最好
I think that means it's time for me to go

I know there's more that's out there
还有更广阔的世界在等着我
And I just haven't found it yet
只是我还尚未发现
I know there's more that's out there

Another me I haven't met

This school is full of people

But still I don't belong
但我仍感孤独
They only dream of winning

Look at me like something's wrong
皆视我如灾祸
Maybe I'm better off alone
也许我该离众独行
Will I find what I'm lookin' for
能否实现我所寻
If I just do it on my own?

I know there's more that's out there
还有更广阔的世界在等着我
Something to fill this hole inside

And I'm not afraid to try

There's only so much this school can offer

But I know there's more that's out there
可我知道世界辽阔
'Cause I've been searching all along
因我一直在寻找
Beyond these rooms, beyond these walls
房间之外 院墙之后
So much to learn, I can't see it all
还有更多 未曾学过
There's somethin' out there callin' me
在外面的世界,有何召唤着我
And it's a mystery that I can't wait to see

'Cause I know there's more that's out there
只因知道世界在外
Another place, another way
新的景色 新的方向
And I know there's more that's out there
在这之外 繁星如海
And I'll find out someday!
我终会发现
I'll find out someday...
我终会发现...
