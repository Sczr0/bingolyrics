We, now, see through the night into the quietness
此刻你我正穿梭黑暗间 遁入静默
And drive into the street, moving on with no destination
漫无目的地在街头行驶着
Sitting there to my left, I glance at you
你就坐在我左侧 我不禁望向你
The side of your face, the moon was shining its light
你侧脸的模样 似月光倾洒般皎洁
Just like, searching around within our history
就犹如探寻着你我的过往
Like crawling carefully, combining words together one by one, I was
谨慎的步伐 就像逐字逐词造句
Feeling the overflowing thoughts, all visions leading to
我百感交集 脑海全部幻象都
Memories of time with you
令我回首曾和你相伴的时光
I know, starting from the day, feeling was set, deciding to live by your side
我知道 自从那天我就决意 陪伴在你身旁
Steadily, gradually all my world’s been changing
平缓时日渐进 我全世界全然改变
Just to be stronger than I feel, and covering the weakness deep within
要比当下的自我更为坚毅 遮掩深藏内心的缺点
Into my days of pretending
开启佯装的生活
Suddenly when you arrived into my life I saw the look deep in your eyes
而顷刻间 你出现在我的人生中
It taught me all that knowledge I had never knew before
从此我也顿悟 前所未有的道理
When there is something to protect that is the only thing I need
既然有想呵护的 就得拼劲全力
To be stronger now than I could ever be, I found
我发觉自己早就比曾经更勇敢
Moving in, moving in deeper into darkest of days
在最阴暗的时日里前行
We would meet, and soon, together, spending our time
我们将会相逢 很快就能陪伴在彼此身旁
“Luring” in new days to be
曾对崭新未来
Full of all the comfort
舒适生活的渴望
It was full of joy and pleasure
都已被幸福和欢愉占据
For you are the one that was saving my soul all along
因为唯有你将我灵魂救赎
Now I can see
现在我知道
Capturing a little fragment of a light it shined a bit and soon revealed
捕捉的光影碎片 熠熠闪耀 即将会显现
Movement of falling drops of tears just like a shooting star
泪落的瞬间就犹如流星划过天际
From a life of imperfection, it’s pouring out and slowly falling down
从不完美的生活出逃 倾泻而出 缓慢落下
Those beautiful drops of tears
那些明亮的泪珠
Even all the tenderness hiding beneath that body, large and powerful
甚至那躯体蕴含全部的温柔 源源不断的能量
Even in that face resembling pain and sorrow
即便那副面透露出痛苦忧伤
I could see beauty, this, I’ve found
我却仍能觅得深藏的美好
The figure isn’t what it’s all about
不是一副躯壳就能一概而论的
I finally have realized
我最终意识到
Echoing into the night, cold unforgiving sound of gunshot in the air
凄凉难以谅解的枪声回荡在夜晚的空气中
“The fading breath, ‘evoking’ our goodbyes approaching soon”
逐渐气咽声嘶 你我的道别也即将到来
And shining for only an instant a merciless shooting star I see
无情的流星划过天际 绽放片刻的光芒
The wishes made upon it disappeared into the dark
我那时许下的心愿 也遁入黑暗之中
In the palm of my hand I felt it burning out
我能在手心中感知那燃烧的炙热
Color of the gold, a comet of sincere true kindness
那金灿 诚挚友善的彗星
Touching the gorgeous mane, so beautiful
抚摸着那惊艳靓丽的秀发
“Deep in the shadows I held tightly within my hands”
我在阴影深处 将其紧握在手
