We, now, see through the night into the quietness
And drive into the street, moving on with no destination
Sitting there to my left, I glance at you
The side of your face, the moon was shining its light
Just like, searching around within our history
Like crawling carefully, combining words together one by one, I was
Feeling the overflowing thoughts, all visions leading to
Memories of time with you
I know, starting from the day, feeling was set, deciding to live by your side
Steadily, gradually all my world’s been changing
Just to be stronger than I feel, and covering the weakness deep within
Into my days of pretending
Suddenly when you arrived into my life I saw the look deep in your eyes
It taught me all that knowledge I had never knew before
When there is something to protect that is the only thing I need
To be stronger now than I could ever be, I found
Moving in, moving in deeper into darkest of days
We would meet, and soon, together, spending our time
“Luring” in new days to be
Full of all the comfort
It was full of joy and pleasure
For you are the one that was saving my soul all along
Now I can see
Capturing a little fragment of a light it shined a bit and soon revealed
Movement of falling drops of tears just like a shooting star
From a life of imperfection, it’s pouring out and slowly falling down
Those beautiful drops of tears
Even all the tenderness hiding beneath that body, large and powerful
Even in that face resembling pain and sorrow
I could see beauty, this, I’ve found
The figure isn’t what it’s all about
I finally have realized
Echoing into the night, cold unforgiving sound of gunshot in the air
“The fading breath, ‘evoking’ our goodbyes approaching soon”
And shining for only an instant a merciless shooting star I see
The wishes made upon it disappeared into the dark
In the palm of my hand I felt it burning out
Color of the gold, a comet of sincere true kindness
Touching the gorgeous mane, so beautiful
“Deep in the shadows I held tightly within my hands”
此刻你我正穿梭黑暗间 遁入静默
漫无目的地在街头行驶着
你就坐在我左侧 我不禁望向你
你侧脸的模样 似月光倾洒般皎洁
就犹如探寻着你我的过往
谨慎的步伐 就像逐字逐词造句
我百感交集 脑海全部幻象都
令我回首曾和你相伴的时光
我知道 自从那天我就决意 陪伴在你身旁
平缓时日渐进 我全世界全然改变
要比当下的自我更为坚毅 遮掩深藏内心的缺点
开启佯装的生活
而顷刻间 你出现在我的人生中
从此我也顿悟 前所未有的道理
既然有想呵护的 就得拼劲全力
我发觉自己早就比曾经更勇敢
在最阴暗的时日里前行
我们将会相逢 很快就能陪伴在彼此身旁
曾对崭新未来
舒适生活的渴望
都已被幸福和欢愉占据
因为唯有你将我灵魂救赎
现在我知道
捕捉的光影碎片 熠熠闪耀 即将会显现
泪落的瞬间就犹如流星划过天际
从不完美的生活出逃 倾泻而出 缓慢落下
那些明亮的泪珠
甚至那躯体蕴含全部的温柔 源源不断的能量
即便那副面透露出痛苦忧伤
我却仍能觅得深藏的美好
不是一副躯壳就能一概而论的
我最终意识到
凄凉难以谅解的枪声回荡在夜晚的空气中
逐渐气咽声嘶 你我的道别也即将到来
无情的流星划过天际 绽放片刻的光芒
我那时许下的心愿 也遁入黑暗之中
我能在手心中感知那燃烧的炙热
那金灿 诚挚友善的彗星
抚摸着那惊艳靓丽的秀发
我在阴影深处 将其紧握在手
