Coming and going are feelings that
Lie deeply, but we can't rewind the time.
Reminiscing about when I last saw your face
Filled with laughter...
Suddenly, you left without a way for me to say goodbye.
How could you be so unfair and leave me behind?
What am I to do now?
I am here, all by myself.
And now I feel the emptiness, realizing...
When you once were there, so close to me...
Took for granted every time you had been here.
But, giving little thought unknowingly,
Now, no longer, will I get to hear the sound of your voice.
Over and over, it plays just like
A broken cassette tape I can't discard...
And it tangles itself. At some point, it's too late.
Left with anger.
Overwhelmed by all the words I couldn't seem to say aloud and,
While filled with what-if's, becomes just self-consuming.
Even though that day was
But a distant memory,
Feels like it just happened yesterday.
But, I know now...
Even when I face the world each night,
Left pretending, still pretending, but it's not right...
But the truth is hard for me to take.
That I'll only get to see you in my faded memories.
Can you hear me there, up in the sky
Looking down at all the world with no way to cry?
Can these feelings reach you when I sink
Into sorrow, far away from who I once was?
I know if you could, you would have stayed
Here beside me, never leaving, if you had a choice.
I know that I should keep going on
With your memory here inside me. Let my voice please reach you.
Sorry for all from before.
Thank you for the memories and all that you've done.
Now wish I could show you at last
That since then I've found my way back... but I'll miss you.
内心的思绪如暗流涌动
然而我们无法倒流时光
遥想最后的相见
你脸上仍挂着微笑
却突然间不辞而别
你怎么忍心  将我弃之不顾
我如今何去何从？
留在此地  孤身只影
周身被空虚包围  方才明白
你曾经就在我身旁   仅仅咫尺之遥
我曾确信无疑  你我将永远形影不离
却未曾思考过未知的可能性
而今  我再也无法倾听你的声音
记忆循环往复
如同断带的卡盘  而我却不忍心丢弃
想做些什么却为时已晚  只得任其层层盘绕
留下的只有忿恨
未道出口的只言片语使我不堪重负
却不断用“如果”麻醉自己
尽管这飘渺的日常
也只是遥远的记忆
却恍若隔日
但如今我明白
哪怕是孤身一人的夜晚
也只是不断的伪装  伪装  但那都是徒劳
事实是如此残酷
我只能在褪色的回忆之中寻觅你的面容
你能否在苍穹之间听见我的残响
回望这个世界  却只能欲哭无泪
当我沉沦于悲伤之际  与以往判若两人
这份情感  是否还能传达
我明白  离开并非你的本愿
如果可以  你愿永远与我相依于此
我明白  我应该迈步向前
有珍贵的回忆随行  让我的心声传达至你
请原谅我以往的种种
感激这一切的回忆  以及你为我所做的一切
最后  只愿你能知晓
我已经不再迷茫  但仍将你牵挂于心
