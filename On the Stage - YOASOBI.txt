Imagining a moment yet to come
My eyes are locked and fixed on visions I've drawn
Of the future me that I pursue
I know it is about to vanish from my view
An overlap ensues
Oh, I believe so
Arriving at the future that I saw
Among so many options, made up my mind
All because, from when I started
I knew in my heart, I could not conceive anything but this
I didn't wanna lose to anyone
So, even in the rough, no giving up
I still kept on running strong
I could endure all, I could endure all
I see, I cannot make it if passion is all I got
In this domain where you either lose or win
It's all about the achievement
No, it's not a joke
I understand it all the same
But I stayed, for the flame inside, fueling my passion
With every day I gotta fight
My every action is building up into the outcome I wanted
I know it's true
So, I'm standing on top of the stage of my dreams
And the challenge is signaled by my heartbeat
Time after time
Been imagining this moment
Outdoing all versions of me, you will see
Taking a deep breath, inhale and exhale
When I'm raising my gaze, and see what unveils
Every day I spent with a scab has untied
The moment I am living now, as it betides
So now, I face the scene I have been dreaming of
I can see it unfold before my eyes
Got so numb and frozen, when facing that absurdity at times
While others would be saying whatever they want
Lost sight of the reasons I've been fighting for and the goal I was chasing
Even then, I thought 'come on, one more time'
I could reach out, and I never gave up
Cause, beside me, always fighting through the daring pain
You were there right from the start
Set on the stage I have dreamt of
I finally reached it
And now I review the path I have pursued
Time after time, I shed so many tears
But each time I stood back up, my will was renewed
Taking a deep breath, inhale and exhale
And slowly my eyes open, sight unveils
I take a step and
I'm going to meet with the future self I imagined that I could be
So, I'm standing on top of the stage of my dreams
And now the signal echoes loud in my ears
Time after time, been imagining this moment
Outdoing all versions of me, I'll prevail
Taking a deep breath, inhale and exhale
And in silence I raise my gaze, it unveils
Everything I've done up to this point in time
I realize wasn't in vain, but led to now
No doubt, the future that I have seen in my dreams
Has started now, unfolding where I stand
So, the scenery I have been dreaming of
The future self I pictured then, is right there in my sight
It's a moment that I'll seize tight
想象着未来某一刻
双眸定格 描绘心之所向
追寻着未来的自己
却知晓幻影即将消散
时光交错
我坚信不疑
抵达梦中的彼岸
面对无数选择 我已决意
源于最初的信念
内心笃定 别无他求
不愿落后他人
风雨兼程 永不放弃
坚韧不拔 无所畏惧
无所不能的我 定能承受一切
我明白 单凭热情无法铸就辉煌
在这胜负分明的竞技场
成就才是硬道理
绝非玩笑
我心知肚明
而我内心的火焰持续燃烧
驱使我日复一日迎战
每一个行动 都是通往目标的基石
我知道 这是不争的事实
如今 我站在梦境的舞台中央
心跳如鼓 预示着挑战的来临
曾无数次
想象这一刻
超越过去的自己 你终将见证
深吸一口气 吐纳之间
仰望舞台 揭开神秘面纱
曾经伤痕累累的日子
如今已成过往
我正经历梦寐以求的现实
在我眼前徐徐展开 清晰可见
面对荒谬 我曾麻木冰封
任由流言蜚语 肆意纷飞
迷失目标 忘却初心
即便如此 我仍心有不甘 再战一场
伸手求援 从未放弃
因为你始终陪伴我左右
共渡苦与痛
如今站在梦寐以求的舞台
终于抵达憧憬的彼岸
回首走过的荆棘之路
泪水曾如雨而下
却在跌倒后 重拾信念
深呼吸 平复心境
视野渐开 揭开迷雾
我将迈出这一步
去遇见曾经想象的自己
于是 我站在梦境的舞台中央
耳畔响起清晰而响亮的信号
曾无数次想象这一刻
超越过去的自己 我终将胜出
深吸一口气 吐纳之间
静默中仰望 揭开迷雾
回首走过的路 方知意义非凡
一切努力终有回报 梦想照进现实
毫无疑问 梦中的未来已悄然降临
在我脚下徐徐展开
梦中的场景 曾经憧憬的自我
此刻清晰可见 触手可及
我将牢牢把握住这珍贵一瞬
