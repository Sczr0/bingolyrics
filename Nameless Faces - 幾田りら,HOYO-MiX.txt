Moonlight, a barren void to horizon
Days blur into nights of dreadful silence oh
You let me see thy heart,
Lost beacon in the dark,
Our lonely souls that spark, we break apart
We find, we strive, our journey of eternity
Desire, in mind, to set our spirits free
Echoes fade to oblivion
Freedom to make our own
We trod our destinies on
A path unknown
With you, rejoice?
Silence falls upon thy shadows and void
Voyage through your labyrinth of misery oh~
Then we escape afar,
To wounded souls that scar
Prisoners of the dark, til we break apart!
We pry, in line, through darkness where the shadows sleep
Our fire, resigned, they let our souls to keep
Gazing for flickers of light
Yearning for fate’s design
Searching for destiny of time
They’ve left behind?
In hope, in vain,
To whom, who waits?
