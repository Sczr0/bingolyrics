I'm holding back right now
Cuz I'm numb to what's around
I miss the life I used to have with you right here
Now everything has turned to grey
And I'm blacking out the shades for now
Let me be sad
Even for a little while
Just a chance to catch my breath
Let me be sad
Even for a little while
Cuz it's all that I have left
When all I see are the memories, I don't want to lose a thing
Let me be sad, let me be sad
Can you see it in my eyes I've been distant?
Cuz I can't tell if it's the end or the beginning
I know I haven't been myself, I'll admit it
I put up walls so if I burned any bridges just know
I'm doin' everything I can to try and fix it
But knowin' me I'll probably miss it
These voices get so vicious
Feels like I'm rippin' stitches
I wish some days I could go back
Before life changed it was so fast
That time is gone and I know that
So please
Let me be sad
Even for a little while
Just a chance to catch my breath
Let me be sad
Even for a little while
Cuz it's all that I have left
When all I see are the memories, I don't want to lose a thing
Let me be sad, let me be sad
I'm doin' everything I can to try and fix it
But knowin' me I'll probably miss it
These voices get so vicious
Feels like I'm rippin' stitches
I wish some days I could go back
Before life changed it was so fast
That time is gone and I know that
All that we have is a moment
So please (let me be)
Let me be sad
Even for a little while
Just a chance to catch my breath
Let me be sad
Even for a little while
Cuz it's all that I have left
When all I see are the memories, I don't want to lose a thing
Let me be sad, Let me be sad
Let me be sad (I'm holding back right now)
Let me be sad (Cuz I'm numb to what's around)
I miss the life I used to have with you right here
Now everything has turned to grey
And I'm blacking out the shades for now
徘徊不前
对周遭一切漠不关心
想念和你一起的昔日时光
如今却晦暗不已
阴影重重
哪怕只有一刹那
哪怕是呼吸的瞬间
也让我感受到刺痛
哪怕只有一瞬间
也让我郁郁寡欢
看着我仅存的往昔回忆
我不想再去失去任何东西
让我感受这痛楚
也许能从我麻木的眼中看出
犹豫不绝的神色
我承认我已迷失
筑起高墙，拒绝沟通
茫然无措
也许还会想起过往
然而言语却像毒针
带着不明的恶意
时如飞梭
我期望能尽快走出来
往昔已不在
所以
让我感受这痛楚
哪怕只有一刹那
哪怕是呼吸的瞬间
也让我郁郁寡欢
也许只有一瞬间
看着我仅存的往昔回忆
我不想再去失去任何东西
让我感受这痛楚
茫然无措
却还会想起过往
甜言蜜语悄然褪色
露出锋利的毒针
时过境迁
我告诫自己
昨日已去
再无从前的我们
所以
让我感受这痛楚
哪怕是
呼吸的瞬间
让我感受这痛楚
也许只有那一瞬间
仅有的往昔回忆
是我不想失去的东西
让我感受这痛楚
让我感受忧愁（徘徊不前）
让我感受绝望（麻木不堪）
想念和你一起的昔日时光
如今却失去色彩
谢幕的时刻到了
