Last Man Standing -Graffiti Ghosts
Your trigger finger better think about your future
You're getting twisted thinking I don't want to shoot ya
I've been waiting for a long time
And I'm coming back to get what's mine
Sick of living with your little double faces
I'm getting itchy and so livid I can taste it
I've been waiting for a long time
And I'm swinging 'til I get what's mine
But I'm not going down
I'm not going down
I'll be the last man standing
The last man standing
You know I never bend I never break
I'm the heavyweight with all the answers
I'm the last man standing
I'm the last man standing
I drew a line into the sand 'cuz
I only plan to be the last man
The last man standing
You're hesitating wasting days I didn't give you
And it's too late to pray or say you didn't think through
We're toe to toe you better make a move
'Cuz I'm standing right in front of you
But I'm not going down
I'm not going down
I'll be the last man standing
The last man standing
You know I never bend I never break
I'm the heavyweight with all the answers
I'm the last man standing
I'm the last man standing
I drew line into the sand 'cuz
I only plan to be the last man
The last man standing
I'll be the last man standing
The last man standing
You know I never bend I never break
I'm the heavyweight with all the answers
I'm the last man standing
I'm the last man standing
I drew line into the sand 'cuz
I only plan to be the last man
The last man standing
