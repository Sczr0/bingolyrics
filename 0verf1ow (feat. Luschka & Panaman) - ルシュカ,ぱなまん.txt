Go out of control
Be wise and fool
Be wise and fool
Like colors with their names
aren't the only ones in frames
We are bound in our own games
Not knowing other ways
I was bored to live inside the box, hard and closed
And then I saw a piece of picture
Something inside me crushed and a siren blared out like a thunder
"Wake up!"
Un…But, I had to go get some bread
You know, it was the ration time
The echo on the wall decayed And was gone
The sound escaped my memory
I'm sorry, but it was bright for me
I won't recapture it I will never…
All I know is what I've been told
Do this or do that And so what?
It's all been decided
Losers can never be choosers
Look for a loophole
To unfold the story unknown
Go out of control
Be wise and fool
All the choices that I've made
All the things that I've craved
These are what a coder's saved
That's what my mother says
An error has been detected
Coz I'm defective
Question arises Why am I here?
What's the meaning of birth?
I feel like a bag of shit
The conclusion is lost
So, I just wanna win back control of myself to find the answer
Reboot the system break the custom
Put up resistance against The Master
A bluster and a siren far in the distance
Volcanic ash is gonna cover up your traces
Oh my god, and look and behold
Do this or do that And so what?
It's all been decided
Losers can never be choosers
Look for a loophole
To unfold the story unknown
Go out of control
Be wise and fool
Be wise and fool
Be wise and fool
别做无谓的抵抗了
愚蠢地模仿去变得聪明吧
愚蠢地模仿去变得聪明吧
好比框架里的颜色
不是每个都有名字那样
我们被困在自己的游戏里
找不到其他出路
我已经厌倦了活在这封闭的盒子里
当看到那张照片
伴随着如雷鸣般的警笛，我的身体里似乎有什么崩坏了
醒醒！
是时候去领我那份
定量供应的粮食
回音渐渐减弱
无法被回想起
对不起，那对我来说太耀眼了
已经再也回不去了
除了被告知的，我一无所知
忙这忙那的，那又能怎样？
一切早已注定
从来轮不到输家去选择
找寻着能续写
未知故事的方法
别做无谓的抵抗了
愚蠢地模仿去变得聪明吧
我所做的选择
想要的一切
都是被程序员设定好的
妈妈是那样告诉我的
检测出了一个错误
我是个缺陷品
生命的意义又是什么？
一切都感觉糟糕透顶
结尾已然遗失
只想夺回主动权，找到答案
重启系统，打破常规
全力抵抗那个“主人”
汽笛声在远处咆哮
火山灰将覆盖你的踪迹
天啊，看……
忙这忙那的，那又能怎样？
一切早已注定
从来轮不到输家去选择
找寻着能续写
未知故事的方法
别做无谓的抵抗了
愚蠢地模仿去变得聪明吧
愚蠢地模仿去变得聪明吧
愚蠢地模仿去变得聪明吧
