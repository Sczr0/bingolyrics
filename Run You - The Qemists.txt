Do what you want to do
Do what you want to do
Do what you want to do
Don't let them run you
Do what you want to do
Do what you want to do
Do what you want to do
Don't let them run you
It doesn't matter what they say
I won't accept it in any single way an ah!
Through the floors an ah!
Through the cabling
They're permeating in through every single day
But I won't be confined by their regimented boarders
We've got the strength of over 50,000 souljah's
And we're not duty bound to anybody's orders
Come on everybody now
Don't let them run you
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
Don't let them run you
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
Don't let them run you
Do what you want to do
Do what you want to do
Do what you want to do
Don't let them run you
(*Scream)Don't let them run you
(*Clean)Don't let them run you
They're gonna take it all away
This is a war and the enemies engaging
But you can see through their lies and decide for your life
But I won't be confined by their regimented boarders
We've got the strength of over 50,000 souljah's
And we're not duty bound to anybody's orders
Come on everybody now
Don't let them run you!

You！

Ahhhhhhhh！
Don't let them run you！

不要受别人操纵
不要受别人操纵
不要受别人操纵
他们要把你带走
这是一场战争，军队已经集合
但你识破他们的谎言，为自己的生活做出决定
我不会被他们的边界限制
我们将有超长的范围
我们也没有义务服从任何人的命令
躁起来吧
不要受别人操纵
无论别人说什么
我不会接受任何一条路
爬上楼房
穿过光缆
他们占据了每一条路
我不会被他们的边界限制
我们将有超长的范围
我们也没有义务服从任何人的命令
躁起来吧
不要受别人操纵
做你想做的
做你想做的
做你想做的
不要受别人操纵
不要受别人操纵

啊
不要受别人操纵
不要受别人操纵
他们想把你带走
这是一场战争，军队已经集合
但你识破他们的谎言，为自己的生活做出决定
我不会被他们的边界限制
我们将有超长的范围
我们也没有义务服从任何人的命令
躁起来吧
